Philip&#8217;s Home</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">HIS days were nearly all spent in a
place where there were great
heights and depths, long corridors and
galleries, with many people passing to
and fro, many chambers above and
below, and elevators running up and
down. A great hotel, do you say? No,
nothing so grand or pleasant as that,
but a deep, dark, dismal mine; and
there, from dawn till after nightfall,
Philip and his mother spent the long,
sun-bright days in a sort of living death.
It was really like that, for what is life
worth in a place where the sun never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
comes, where there is no grass nor
flowers nor trees, where the beautiful
blue sky with its snow-white flying
cloudlets or great, gray, snow-capped
cloud-mountains cannot be seen, and
where there is nothing but the darkness
of night all the day long!</p>

<p>But Philip was quite accustomed to
this strange underground life, and as he
knew nothing of anything different or
better he was as happy as the day was
long. After all, our lives are very
much what we make them, and Philip
was blessed with a very sweet and
cheerful nature, which could make its
own sunshine even at the bottom of a
deep, dark mine; he had beside a very
strong and healthy fancy, and he had
peopled the dark recesses of the mine
with all kinds of imaginary beings, who
were real companions for the lonely
child. Instead, however, of creating, as
some foolish children would have done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
only gnomes and goblins to inhabit the
deep caverns and underground chambers,
Philip chose rather to pretend that
the soft sound of dropping water, which
could always be heard if one listened,
was the musical language of the coal-fairies
who guarded the secrets of the
mine, a language which only those who
were very pure and good could understand.</p>

<p>There was another sprite who lived
in the mine, with whom Philip used to
hold long conversations, and who could
always reply to him, although the answer
was sometimes unsatisfactory; this
was the echo of his own voice, and one
day the little boy lost his way and
caused his mother great alarm by following
this mocking voice deep into
the intricate windings of an unworked
shaft. He found his way out again on
this particular occasion by the aid of
some other spirit-friends of his, the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
lamps or candles which the miners carry
in their hats. At a distance these lights,
glancing here and there as the men
moved about their work, looked exactly
like large fireflies, and it was by following
these and answering the friendly
voices of the miners who shouted directions
to him that Philip found his way
back to his mother&#8217;s side again.</p>

<p>And so you see that Philip led what
I suppose most boys and girls would
have called a very hard and lonely life,
for he had few companions of his
own age, and spent most of the time
which other children have for play in
sober work, yet he was quite happy and
contented; and indeed he was much
more fortunate than many of the people
about him, who did not, like him, come
up when the day was over, but who
spent days and sometimes weeks or
months down in the darkness of the
mine, with never a glimpse of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
blessed light of day, except what little
could be seen from the long well-like
shaft, up and down which went the
buckets or elevators by which the miners
were carried to and from their work.
But when Philip&#8217;s day in the mine was
over he had only to step aboard the
rough elevator which carried the miners
up and down, and looking upward, as
he always did on this journey back to
the outer world, he could see the tall
derrick which pointed skyward from
the mouth of the shaft like a black
finger grow gradually more distinct
against the blue sky, and then in a
moment more he would come out into
the daylight once again.</p>

<p>The bright sunshine always hurt
his eyes at first, but how pleasant and
warm it seemed after the damp twilight
down below! And how glorious it
was to be able to run straight ahead
for miles without being obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
stoop beneath low, dripping walls, or
to squeeze through narrow openings
into close, rocky chambers where the
stagnant air made one cough and choke!
It was almost worth while, Philip
thought, to spend eight hours of the
day away from this beautiful world of
nature in order to come back to it
again each afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do ye think, mother dear,&#8221; he
said thoughtfully, one beautiful summer
evening as they were walking home
together through a field gay and fragrant
with innumerable wild flowers&mdash;&#8220;do
ye think that heaven can be a
nicer place than this?&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother smiled at her boy&#8217;s
earnest question, and laid her hard,
rough hand on his curly head in a loving
way she had. &#8220;I reckon it is, my
little lad,&#8221; she said, &#8220;though we can&#8217;t
quite think of it; but they says the
flowers there never wither nor die, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the sky is always blue, not lowering
and black as our sky is sometimes&mdash;ye
mind how it looked before the thunder-storm
last night. The pleasures in
that land will leave no ugly sting behind
them, folks tells us, as they does
here &#8217;most always.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with a sad wistfulness in
her voice which Philip was quick to
notice, and he slipped his little hand
into hers and looked up into her face
with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, mother dear,&#8221; he said
gently, &#8220;why you are always so sad
when we cross this field, especially in
daisy time. Is it because my father
used to walk here with you in the
time ye said ye was used be happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>How marvellously wise love makes
us all! Philip&#8217;s mother looked down
at him wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;However did the lad guess?&#8221; she
said as though to herself; &#8220;for it was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
this very field we used to wander in
those happy, foolish days. Oh, it would
have been far better had we never&#8221;&mdash;she
did not finish the sentence, but
broke off quite suddenly, telling Philip
to run on ahead; and the boy did as he
was bidden, but half reluctantly, for
although he seldom spoke of his father,
feeling instinctively that the subject
was a painful one to his mother, yet
he thought about him very often, pondering
as children will upon a theme
not understood or only half explained.
He knew that his father was dead&mdash;so
much his mother had told him; and
many a time he had heard her say that
if it were not for her boy she could find
it in her heart to wish herself dead too.
He also knew that a locket which his
mother always wore on a chain about
her neck contained a portrait which
she had once shown to him, and which
she had told him was a perfect likeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of his father. Philip looked wonderingly
at the face of the handsome
young gentleman, who had clustering
curls like his own, but whose clothes
were of a cut and texture quite unlike
those worn by the men whom Philip
saw every day; and then as his glance
had fallen upon his mother in her
rough dress, he said with a kind of
awe, &#8220;What fine clothes my father
wore, didn&#8217;t he, mother dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>And his mother had snatched the
miniature almost fiercely from his hand,
saying proudly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he did, lad; your father
was a <i>gentleman</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gentleman! Philip thought of it
often afterward, wondering what his
mother could have meant, for the only
gentlemen the boy had ever seen lived
in fine houses, and their wives rode in
carriages and wore silk dresses and
fine bonnets, while their home was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
humble miner&#8217;s cottage, and his mother&mdash;and
then Philip, half ashamed of the
thought, had run and put his arms about
his mother&#8217;s neck and smoothed the
coarse cotton cloth of her dress with
his loving hands, telling himself that
although she did not wear the fine
clothes of a lady, yet she was as sweet
and beautiful and good as any lady in
the land.</p>

<p>It never occurred to Philip to wonder
that Mag (the only name by which his
mother was known) could neither read
nor write, for the people who lived all
about them, and who spent the greater
part of their lives in the mine, were of
course very ignorant, there being no
such things in those days as compulsory
education or laws forbidding child-labor
in the mines. Philip, therefore,
at ten years of age did not know a
single letter of the alphabet, and had
seen only one or two books in his life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
But although his mother was no wiser
than her child so far as books went,
she seemed somehow to have gained a
strange knowledge of life; indeed, no
one could look at her without feeling
sure that she had loved and felt and
suffered much. She was a large, grand-looking
young woman, with a face and
figure like a Greek statue, and she was
almost as silent. Philip had never
heard her laugh, and she seldom talked
with the miners or joined in their rough
merriment and sometimes rather coarse
jokes. In reply to their greetings or
questions she always gave short, civil
enough answers, never voluntarily prolonging
the conversation. But her
silence was never sullen, and they all
seemed to understand her; indeed,
there was not one of them who would
not gladly have done her a good turn,
and she always acknowledged their
favors gratefully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>It was often remarked that she
seemed to take a sort of fierce pleasure
in doing the hardest and roughest
kinds of work, labor which usually was
given only to the men; but she was
still young and very strong, and it may
have been that she dreaded the time
for thought which idleness might have
brought. At any rate, she chose the
work and labored faithfully and patiently
for the wages which supported
her father and child.</p>

<p>Philip was constantly with his
mother, and as he was a trifle shy
and made few friends among the rough
boys and girls of the neighborhood, he
seemed to have concentrated all the
affection of his warm little heart upon
Mag, who loved him in return with a
passionate devotion.</p>

<p>Philip and Mag and her old father
were happy together in their humble
home, which, although it was precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the same as all the other huts which
were huddled together around the
opening of the mine, had about it
an unusual air of comfort and refinement.
There were white curtains at
the small windows, a honeysuckle
climbed over the porch, and at one
side was a small garden, where it was
Philip&#8217;s delight to work with his grandfather;
it was always gay with flowers,
which seemed to thrive in spite of the
poor soil, and there were vegetables and
berries too, which often found their way
to the tables of less fortunate neighbors.
Within the cottage were a few small
comforts not usually to be found in the
miners&#8217; dwellings, a square or two
of carpet, faded and worn, but warm
and comfortable under the feet on
cold nights, a red table-cover to replace
the white one used for meals
(a most unusual luxury), and a lamp
with a colored silk shade. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
besides an easy-chair or two, and in one
corner a plain oak writing-desk which
was regarded by the neighbors with
some awe; it was carefully locked, and
Philip had often wondered where the
key which fitted it might be, but somehow
he had always hesitated to ask,
feeling, perhaps almost instinctively,
that the explanation might cause his
mother pain or embarrassment.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter II<br />

Dash</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NEXT to Mag and his grandfather
Philip loved his dog Dash better
than anything else in the world. He
was a ragged little terrier with a head
much too large for his body, a short
stump of a tail, and an awkward way
of getting under people&#8217;s feet and of
tumbling all over himself when he
ran; but he was a marvel of faithfulness
and affection, and could do a multitude
of the clever tricks which Philip
delighted to teach him.</p>

<p>He had come to the door of the cottage
one wild, stormy night, and had
wailed so piteously outside that Mag
said at last:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>&#8220;Go, Philip, lad, unbolt the door; it
is likely some poor dog perishing in
the storm. We are not so poor but we
can give the poor thing food and shelter
for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Philip ran and opened the door,
and the little dog ran in and cowered
shivering before the fire; he was very
wet and dirty, and so thin that the
bones in his poor little body stood out
in a way that was quite pitiful to see;
he had a jagged end of rope about his
neck, as though he had broken away
from some place of confinement; his
feet were cut and bleeding, as though
he had travelled a long distance; and
he had a general air of being quite done
up and exhausted.</p>

<p>Philip brought him some food and
water, and you should have seen the
look of gratitude in the creature&#8217;s eyes
as he wagged his poor little stump of a
tail, stopping now and then, hungry as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was, to lick the kind hand that fed him.
Philip made a comfortable bed for him
beside the fire, but next morning when
he awoke and sat up in his own little
bed, which stood beside his mother&#8217;s,
there was his small new friend sitting
gravely beside him, quietly waiting
for him to awake. Later, when Mag
missed her little boy from her side, she
discovered him, still in his night-clothes,
rolling about on the floor, in
play with the dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; he cried when she
called to him, &#8220;please may I keep him
for my very own? Only see how we
love each other already!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mag, her great love for her boy
shining in her dark eyes, laid her hand
kindly on the little dog&#8217;s shaggy head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, ye may keep the creature,
Philip,&#8221; she said, &#8220;provided his proper
owner does na&#8217; call for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no one ever came to claim him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and from that day Philip and Dash were
inseparable, except during the hours
when Philip was down in the mine
with his mother; there the dog was not
allowed to follow his young master,
but he would go with him every morning
to the entrance of the shaft, and
stand looking down, after the car
which carried the miners to their work
had started on its downward journey.
When it was quite out of sight he
would turn with a whimper and trot
home again with a business-like air,
seldom stopping to play with other
dogs by the way, and staying very
quietly and obediently with the old
grandfather for the rest of the day.
But at the exact hour when it was to
be expected that the car would come
up again from the mine, bringing the
men, with Philip and his mother, there
would be Dash waiting for them, and
ready to escort them home each night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with as much joy as though he had not
seen them for a month. No one ever
knew how the little fellow could always
be sure of the exact time when Philip
might be expected, but he was never
known to be late, except on one occasion
when his grandfather had gone to
a neighbor&#8217;s, leaving Dash locked in the
cottage. He must have managed to
climb out of the window, which was
several feet above the ground, for he
came galloping down the road just as
the miners were saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Philip, lad, thy friend is failing
thee the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dash came by his name in quite an
extraordinary way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye may depend upon it, such a
clever dog has a handle to him already,&#8221;
said Philip&#8217;s grandfather when
the boy suggested that his pet should
have a name.</p>

<p>&#8220;But however could we guess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
right one?&#8221; said Philip doubtfully.
Nevertheless he began to mention over
in the little animal&#8217;s hearing several
names common to dogs, such as Rover,
Gyp, Sport, and the like, while his
dumb playmate stood before him, wagging
his short tail as much as to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could help you, master,
but you haven&#8217;t struck it yet, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mag was sitting as usual by the
table with the lamp, sewing quietly, but
though she said little she would glance
up now and then from her work and
look lovingly at the little group before
the fire. Suddenly she spoke: &#8220;I have
thought of a name for the dog,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Perhaps he may be called&mdash;Dash.&#8221;
She spoke the name emphatically, with
a slight pause before it, and instantly
the dog flew to her side as though she
had called him, and stood wagging his
tail and looking from Mag to Philip,
saying as plainly as a dog could:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s my name&mdash;did you call me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; said Philip, clapping
his hands with delight and surprise,
&#8220;that is his name, I am sure of it&mdash;only
see how knowing he looks! Here,
Dash! Dash!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Dash! Dash!&#8221; echoed Mag,
almost smiling with the pleasure and
excitement which she shared with her
little son; and the dog ran wildly from
one to the other, barking and frisking
about for joy, as though delighted to be
no longer a stray and nameless cur, but
a dog with a name, and therefore with
some claim to respectability.</p>

<p>&#8220;However did you guess it, mother?&#8221;
asked Philip afterward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly, myself,&#8221; said
Mag, &#8220;unless it is,&#8221; she added slyly,
&#8220;that your friends the coal fairies
whispered the name in my ear.&#8221; And
Philip blushed, for he was secretly a
little ashamed of what he felt to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
rather foolish sport for a boy who was
earning his four shillings a week in
the mine.</p>

<p>From this time on Philip was never
conscious of the lack of companionship,
which, in the days before Dash came,
he had sometimes felt so sadly; for
from henceforth he had a constant
playfellow, who was always sweet-tempered
and eager to frolic and play,
yet ready too, at a sign from his young
master, to lie quietly down beside him
when Philip was tired of playing and
wanted to pore over his books; for
although the boy could not read, yet
it was his chief delight to look at the
pictures in some volumes which he
had found one day packed carefully
away in an old trunk, and which Mag
told him had belonged to his father.
There were fortunately many illustrations
in these books, and he had his
own way of enjoying them, by making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
up stories for the pictures as he went
along, to Dash, who was a most attentive
listener, and who really seemed to
enjoy the recital quite as much as Philip.
He would lie quite still before the fire,
with his black nose thrust in between
the pages of the book, and his sharp,
bright eyes fixed attentively on Philip&#8217;s
face; occasionally he would thump contentedly
on the floor with his tail, and at
such times Mag would look up from her
work to smile lovingly at her boy, as in
a low voice he would weave his pretty
fancies about the pictures; sometimes,
too, she would break in with suggestions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I could help ye there,
Philip,&#8221; she would say. &#8220;I remember
your father told me summat about that
picture; it was one he was always over-fond
of, an&#8217; sometimes he would try to
tell me about what was in the books.
I wish I could remember better for
your sake, my lad.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>It was really pathetic to see with
what attention she had tried to follow
the narrative or explanation, and it
was quite wonderful how much of the
recital she could recall, in almost the
exact words in which she had heard it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How clever my father must have
been!&#8221; said Philip thoughtfully, and
Mag would reply proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he was, lad; he could
read out of the book just as smooth as
talking.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she would usually lapse
into silence again, and perhaps say no
more that evening. And Philip loved
his father&#8217;s books, and longed to be
able to master their contents.</p>

<p>One of the overseers at the mine,
who was regarded as quite a scholar
by the ignorant miners, had noticed
Philip&#8217;s interest in the newspaper
which he sometimes brought down
into the mine to be glanced over at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
odd moments when the men were all
at work around him and he had little
to do but keep a general eye on the
others. One day in a burst of kindly
feeling he pointed out some of the letters
in the head-lines of the paper to
Philip, and explained how, when put
together, they made words and sentences.
Finding the boy an apt pupil
and very eager to learn, he became
quite interested in teaching him to
read, in much the same way as he
might have found amusement in training
an intelligent dog to fetch and
carry, or to stand up and beg. To
Philip this opened a whole world
of wonder and delight. To be sure
he did not learn at once, and sometimes
weeks would pass when his
friend would find no time to teach him;
but the boy waited patiently, and
meanwhile he had his own way of enjoying
the gradual acquaintance which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
he was making with the great Alphabet
Family, from A, the dignified and
rather stern father, and B, the fat,
good-natured mother of the flock,
down to the youngest letter of the
family, funny little crooked Baby Z.</p>

<p>Every evening during the time of
those first lessons in the rudiments of
learning, Philip could scarcely wait to
get home, so anxious was he to tell
Dash of the new letters which he had
learned from the overseer&#8217;s paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it funny, Dash?&#8221; he would
say. &#8220;Here is M&mdash;him I have known
quite well for over a week, and always
thought he was a very well-behaved
and polite young letter, and here to-day,
right in the middle of a page, I
find him standing on his head; and&mdash;did
ye ever see the like?&mdash;he&#8217;s changed
his name and calls himself W. And
then here is O&mdash;I always knew him
the minute I saw him. He seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
almost to jump out at me from the
page, he&#8217;s that round and fat and easy
to remember; and now only see here,
Dash, they have gone and put a little
handle on him, something like your
tail, you see, and now he is called Q.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Dash and Philip studied the alphabet
together, and the little boy, from
weaving fancies about the letters and
the pictures in his father&#8217;s books, came
to have long waking dreams, which
were so beautiful that he longed to tell
his mother about them; but somehow
when he tried to put them into words,
Mag did not seem to understand, but
would only shake her head and say
kindly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy head grows dull, Philip, from
sitting so much in the house. Go now
an&#8217; have a run with Dash in the fresh
air.&#8221;</p>

<p>And sometimes when Philip would
be loath to leave his book, his mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
would shake her head more decidedly,
and perhaps push him gently out of
the house, closing the door behind him;
while Philip, knowing that it was only
love which prompted her seeming harshness,
would shake himself out of his
dreamy mood, and cry, &#8220;Come, Dash,
mother is right; let&#8217;s have a race. One,
two, three! Go!&#8221; And away they
would both scamper.</p>

Philip&#8217;s Mother</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE winter that Dash came to the
cottage where Philip lived with
his mother and grandfather was a very
long and hard one. A great political
crisis had, in some mysterious way,
affected the price of coal; there were
long weeks when only half the usual
number of men were employed in the
mines, and this meant that many little
children in the miners&#8217; cottages went
often supperless to bed, while the men
would gather in groups in the street
and talk gloomily of the hard times,
which seemed to offer little hope of
improvement. There was much illness
in the town, too; a season of unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
rain and fog, less fire than usual to
keep the chill out of the houses, and
constitutions weakened by anxiety and
lack of food made ready a fertile
soil for the fever which attacked and
carried off many scores of victims,
especially among the little children and
the aged; the good village doctor was
kept busy day and night, and his old-fashioned
hooded phaeton, with its
patient old gray horse which all the
children in the village knew and petted,
might be seen constantly going back
and forth from house to house, sometimes
until quite late into the night.</p>

<p>Mag was one of the few who had
steady work, but her wages had been
reduced one-half, and with all her
clever management it was sometimes
difficult to keep the little household
warmed and fed. Philip&#8217;s earnings had
ceased altogether, and although he had
more time above-ground, yet he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
gladly have exchanged this unaccustomed
freedom for the toil which
would have brought a few extra comforts
into their little home. It made
his tender heart ache, too, to see the
lines of anxiety grow each day deeper
on the faces of Mag and his grandfather;
often when he was playing with
Dash he would find his mother&#8217;s eyes
fastened upon them both, with a sad
intensity which would sometimes lead
him to run to her and put his little arms
close about her neck, whispering:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, mother dear; God will
take care of us.&#8221; And on these occasions
Dash would always join the
group, thrusting his cold nose into their
faces, and making it so evident that he
shared their distress that they would
laugh in spite of themselves at his
awkward efforts to express his affection
and sympathy.</p>

<p>Dearly as he loved her, Philip stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in awe of his silent mother, and he
used sometimes to wonder in his childish
way why it was that even when
work had been plenty and wages high
she was still so sad and grave, so
unlike her noisy, gossipy neighbors,
who he noticed used sometimes to
shake their heads as though in kindly
pity when she passed their doors on
her way to work. Philip had heard
the miners, too, say as they looked
after her retreating figure:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor lass! Poor Maggie!&#8221;</p>

<p>But whatever the sorrow that had
darkened her life, she never allowed it
to blind her to the troubles of others,
and her neighbors seemed to understand
this, for if ever sickness or accident
befell any of them, who so quick
as Mag to help or befriend? Many a
blessing followed her that winter as,
her work for the day finished, she
would hurry from house to house on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
countless errands of mercy, often going
quietly without her supper, that
some little delicacy prepared by her
own hands might find its way to an
ailing neighbor. Philip noticed that
when his mother returned from these
kind errands she always seemed more
contented than usual, and the happiest
time in the whole day was when, her
bonnet removed and her shawl neatly
folded and laid away, she would light
the evening lamp and sit quietly down
to her sewing, while her father dozed
contentedly in his chair before the fire
(sometimes, alas! a feeble enough
blaze) and Philip and Dash played
happily together on the hearth.</p>

<p>Philip never remembered but one
occasion when his mother had spoken
to him other than very gently, but that
once he never forgot. It was an evening
when, tired of romping with Dash,
the little boy had curled up before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
fire with a picture-book which had been
loaned to him by the overseer&#8217;s child.
It was a rare treat, and Philip soon became
quite absorbed in this new object
of interest. But Dash was determined
not to be cheated out of his usual half
hour of play with his young master, and
after waiting as long as he thought that
even the best-behaved dog could be expected
to do, he began to pull at Philip&#8217;s
sleeve as though to say: &#8220;Come, old
fellow. Time&#8217;s up, you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>But as Philip paid no attention to this,
he began to bark and frisk about him in
such a lively and disturbing manner
that Philip pushed him away several
times, saying, &#8220;Down, Dash,&#8221; in a vexed
and impatient voice; but the little dog
persisted in teasing and annoying him
all the more for being rebuffed, and at
last Philip grew angry, and struck and
kicked the dog several times. Dash
was so astonished at this unusual behavior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
that for a moment he stood looking
at his master in silent reproach,
and then he turned sadly away, and ran,
yelping and whining, to Mag. She
turned and caught her little son by the
arm, holding him so tightly that he
cried out in surprise and pain. His
mother&#8217;s great sorrowful eyes were fixed
upon him with an expression so unusual
that he remembered it long afterward.
She was very pale as she cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame on ye, Philip lad, to hurt the
brute that loves ye an&#8217; canna&#8217; strike
back! Oh, Philip, Philip, ye must keep
down that temper, my little lad, or it
will bring you to the woe that&#8217;s wearing
me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank into a chair, covering her
face with her trembling hands, and
rocking herself to and fro as she said
softly, and as though speaking to herself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mag, ye have given your own
wicked temper to the child, to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
curse to him as it has been to yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped her hands at her side
and gazed at Philip with such mournful
eyes that although he could not
understand the meaning of her words,
he was frightened and shrank into his
corner, his face burning with shame
and remorse. Dash had stood looking
from one to the other, as though
bewildered by such a strange scene, and
presently he crept up to Philip, thrusting
his nose timidly into the boy&#8217;s hand,
as much as to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t feel so badly, Philip. I know
you didn&#8217;t mean to hurt me, and it was
mean to tease you when I knew you
wanted to read. Come, let bygones be
bygones&mdash;that&#8217;s my motto.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Philip patted his rough head,
and the companions felt that they had
been mutually understood and forgiven.
But with Mag it was different. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
took up her sewing again, to be sure,
and went on with her work as usual,
but she paid no heed to Philip&#8217;s timid
efforts to explain and ask forgiveness.
Indeed, she seemed not to see him, for
her thoughts had wandered apparently
far away; and after a while Philip stole
off to bed, wondering sadly why his
fit of ill-temper should have so strangely
moved his silent mother.</p>

<p>The next morning Mag seemed still
constrained and unhappy, and went
about her work in an absent-minded
way, scarcely heeding Philip&#8217;s timid
efforts at conversation; so shortly after
breakfast he stole quietly out of the
house with Dash. They did not return
until dinner-time, and as they approached
the house Philip perceived with a sinking
of the heart that the good doctor&#8217;s
carriage was fastened to the gate-post
in front of their little cottage. He flew
rather than ran the remainder of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
distance, and his mother met him at the
door, a warning finger on her lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she said; &#8220;your grandfather
is ill. I saw he was not over-well this
week past, and this morning he could
not eat; so when I saw the doctor pass,
I hailed him in. I fear&mdash;it may be&mdash;the
fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with a catch in her voice,
but she tried to smile as she put her
arm around Philip with more than her
usual tenderness and drew him into
the house. The doctor was coming
out of the sick man&#8217;s room, and he was
looking rather grave; but he said little,
only leaving some powders, with directions
as to food and other matters,
promising to call again later in the day.
The old man grew no worse, however,
and indeed in a few days he persisted
in leaving his bed and coming out to
his favorite seat beside the fire; but he
seemed to have but little strength, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to have grown much older in those few
days of illness.</p>

<p>The first evening that he took his
place again in the family circle was a
memorable one for Philip. The boy had
always been a great favorite with his
grandfather, who delighted to ask him
questions about what he had seen during
the day; there was never much to
tell, but Philip had a whimsical fashion
of making a great deal of a small
adventure in relating it, and often some
trifling remark would suggest past events
to the old man, and he would tell the
boy strange stories of the past, which
though often repeated were always new
and of absorbing interest to his grandson
and to Mag, who was ever an interested
listener.</p>

<p>On this particular evening, however,
she seemed listless and distraught, and
after a while she left her sewing and
knelt in front of the fire in a drooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
attitude, which made Philip ask at last
half timidly (for since the episode with
Dash he had not felt quite at ease with
his mother):</p>

<p>&#8220;Are ye cold, mother dear? Shall
I put a few coals on the fire?&#8221; She
shook her head without replying, and
after a moment Philip asked his grandfather
for a story; but, to the great surprise
of both, Mag suddenly spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; she said, &#8220;both of
ye; it is my turn to tell the story to-night,
an&#8217; ye must listen patiently while
I tell it, even though it may seem over-long.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her hand to her throat as
though something there choked her,
and in the flickering firelight her eyes
gleamed strangely. Philip was so dumbfounded
at the idea of his silent mother
telling him a story that he looked from
her to his grandfather in amazement.
The old man shook his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>&#8220;My poor lass!&#8221; he said softly.
&#8220;Perhaps it will ease the poor troubled
mind of ye to tell it to the lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mag began her story in a cold,
hard voice, with her eyes still fixed
upon the fire and her position unchanged.</p>

Mag&#8217;s Story</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">&#8220;LONG ago, aye, very long ago, it
seems now, there was a girl
with a temper so bad that no one could
stand her ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, lass,&#8221; interrupted her father,
&#8220;don&#8217;t ye say that. Let me begin the
story for thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the old man took it up in the
dialect of the miners, which to the
readers of this would hardly seem like
English, and for their benefit must be
put into plainer language.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there was a girl,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;an&#8217; the handsomest one ever I saw.
Maybe she had somewhat of a temper,
but no one could look into her face and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
think a bit blame for what she said.
An&#8217; what a voice she had! There was
not a linnet could sing like her, an&#8217;
when all went straight she was singing
all the time. There was no one to
look after this girl, poor lammie, for
the mother of her died before she had
sense to miss her, an&#8217; left her to the
care of a foolish old father, who had
small enough knowledge of the proper
way to bring up a little lass. He took
her down into the mine with him sometimes,
but it wasn&#8217;t to her taste&mdash;the
darkness fretted her, she wanted more
liberty. If there had been a school at
the place it would have been the making
of her, for she had a quick mind,
an&#8217; it was a great worry to the father
that she couldn&#8217;t be put to something
fitting for a little lass; but he was near
daft with the advising of one an&#8217;
another. One&#8217;s wife would be for having
her sent to town to be put to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
trade; another&#8217;s wife was for having
her sent to learn service with some
great lord&#8217;s housekeeper; an&#8217; there
wasn&#8217;t a man&#8217;s wife of them all but
had some plan to drive him crazy with,
an&#8217; not one of them telling of a way
that had a possibility in it, or that the
girl took a liking to, for she&#8217;d fly out at
all the ones that came advising. Not
that she was a bad lass, if you took
her fair, but wilful-like, an&#8217;, maybe, too
quick with her tongue when she took a
turn; but that was more the father&#8217;s
fault, who had never taught her the
right ways for a little lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip did not find the story as interesting
yet as some of the more exciting
ones his grandfather told sometimes, of
the three or four years he had been at
sea when he ran away from home;
but he listened patiently for what was
to come, glancing anxiously at his
mother, who still knelt in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fire, with her head bent low on her
breast and her hands clasped in front
of her. Philip had never seen her cry
before, but now, to his surprise, great
tears gathered in her mournful eyes,
and once he was sure he heard a stifled
sob; but the story began to grow more
interesting then, and in listening he
forgot to watch her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, she was a rare lassie!&#8221; pursued
the old man; &#8220;an&#8217; when she was but
just at her growth, an&#8217; not half come to
her strength, she saved the lives of two
of the best men in the mines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, grandfather, how did she do
that?&#8221; interrupted Philip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be telling ye the whole of
it, because one story inside of another
spoils the both to the taste; but I&#8217;ll give
ye a notion of how it was,&#8221; resumed
the old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a side shaft in those
days to a vein that isn&#8217;t worked now;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
an&#8217; being the nighest to some of their
houses the men used to go up and down
on it, though the superintendent was
sayin&#8217; all he could against their using it,
because there wasn&#8217;t a very safe way
of running it. There was a hand-windlass
to the top to work the bucket, an&#8217; a
snubbing-post near to give the rope a
turn &#8217;round so a man could hold it
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the lass used to come every
night to watch the men getting out of
that shaft, &#8217;cause she knew the foolish
father of her would be coming up
wearying to see if his bairn that had to
be left alone the day through was all
safe. So one night she stood watching
the first load of night-men going
down to the mine, knowing that when
the bucket came up the father&#8217;d be in
it; an&#8217; she watched the men&#8217;s faces,
going down into the dark, turning up to
look at her, an&#8217; one of &#8217;em throwing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
joke at her for being like a boy bairn
more than a lassie. Poor thing, with
only a great rough father, an&#8217; no one
to show her the ways of women folks,
what shame was it of hers? When
they went down from the sight of her,
she turns to the man at the rope, an&#8217;
what does she see? Just the rope paying
itself out an&#8217; no one to hold it back,
an&#8217; him grinding his chin into the earth
in a fit. She looks quick to see if there
is help coming, but never a man was in
sight, an&#8217; the rope slipping away. Then
she knew the danger they were in, for
the old shaft went far deeper than the
gallery the rope left them at, an&#8217; when
the end of it ran out the bucket would
drop down where the water had broken
in long ago and forced them to give up
the lower drift.</p>

<p>&#8220;She hadn&#8217;t much time to spare when
the loss of a minute would mean death
to the men. So what does she do then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
do you think, this lassie that had none
of the soft ways of a girl bairn? Why,
just gives the rope a turn around her
waist, an&#8217; then braces her two feet
against a stone an&#8217; pulls against the
roller, an&#8217; waits for the jerk. An&#8217; there
was the men down below not knowing
but what Michael held the rope the
same as ever, getting off the bucket all
safe, an&#8217; the lassie&#8217;s own father an&#8217; the
other men climbing in an&#8217; giving the
signal to be fetched up, not knowing
that the heft of &#8217;em was dragging on
the body of the poor lass, who was
past feeling then, for she had fainted
into a dead swoon. That&#8217;s the way the
new men found her when they came to
the shaft to take their turn at going
down, an&#8217; her dragged up against the
post an&#8217; held there by the weight of
the bucket hanging, an&#8217; Michael lying
by groaning an&#8217; gripping the ground
still.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, grandfather! did it kill her?&#8221;
gasped Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better if it had&mdash;better if it had!&#8221;
groaned Mag, raising her bent head,
but not turning around.</p>

<p>Grandfather wiped his eyes and
cleared his throat once or twice, as if
he found the recollection of that time
overwhelming; then, after two or three
long whiffs at his pipe to keep it from
quite going out, began again in a tremulous
voice, which grew steadier as he
went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say as &#8217;twould &#8217;a&#8217; been better
for her if she had,&#8221; said he, apparently
heeding Mag&#8217;s words more than Philip&#8217;s
question; &#8220;happen it might ha&#8217; saved
her worse trouble, but it wasn&#8217;t to be.
She was mangled though, an&#8217; parson
came over when he heard of it, bringing
the town doctor with him, an&#8217;
they found a deal of the ribs crushed
and one shoulder put out of joint; an&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the wives of the men she saved an&#8217; the
mothers of them nursed and cared for
her, an&#8217; there&#8217;s not a man in the mine
to this day, nor a woman belonging to
him, that wouldn&#8217;t stand up for her
against the world, an&#8217; well they might.
But the best is to come: the papers got
the story of it, an&#8217; the greatest gentry in
the land got to know of what the little
lass did for the men; an&#8217; the Queen,
God save her, sent her a gold medal.
&#8216;For the Saving of Human Life&#8217; was
writ on to it, an&#8217; some great society
sent her another in a velvet case.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; now, Maggie, woman,&#8221; said he
coaxingly to his daughter, &#8220;up and tell
the lad who was the little lassie, an&#8217; let
him hear no more about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said the woman, rising and
turning around with her eyes dry and
glistening now, &#8220;it&#8217;s all to be told; if
ye cannot tell it, I must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Save us all, woman dear,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
old man, rising and patting his daughter
soothingly on the arm; &#8220;don&#8217;t get into
such a wax. If the little lad must hear
the whole story through, why then he
must, an&#8217; who can tell it him better nor
me? But there&#8217;s no need for his hearing
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father, you can tell it if you
will, but ye must tell it all, an&#8217; keep
nothing back, or I shall have to tell it
myself; for I am determined that my
child shall know just what a wicked
temper can bring one to, if it&#8217;s let to go
on and get the mastery.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mag said this she turned wearily
to the little stand where her basket of
clothes for mending stood, and seated
herself by it, but not to sew. Pushing
the candle and work away from her,
she put her folded arms upon the table
and dropped her head upon them, turning
her face away from the others.</p>

<p>Philip had become much interested in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the story of the heroic girl who had
risked so much to save the miners, and
he was anxious to hear more about her;
but the old man seemed in no hurry to
go on with the story. He knocked the
ashes out of his pipe, refilled it, took an
unnecessarily long time in lighting it,
and made various delays, till at last an
uneasy movement of his daughter made
him start off on it at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this lass as I&#8217;m telling of,&#8221;
he began, turning to Phil, &#8220;this brave
one that the whole of the men was
willing to lay down their lives for, got
all over her hurts and bruises, and was
&#8217;round on her feet again as well as ever.
They was feared, they was, both doctor
an&#8217; parson, that the spine of her back
had gotten a bending that would never
get out of it; but no fear for her&mdash;when
she left her bed (an&#8217; it was all the
broken bones could do to keep her in
it at all) she was as straight as a Maypole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
an&#8217; there couldn&#8217;t have been a face
more bonny than hers, an&#8217; it grew bonnier
every day till it was more trouble
than ever to me&mdash;to the father, I
mean&mdash;to know a way to look after
one that was like a young queen for
beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;She had no liking those times for
going down into the mines, or, for that
matter, for work of any kind. There
was many an honest lad among the
workmen that fair doated on the sight
of her, but she had no care for one of
them; an&#8217; her father was content to
have it so, for he was proud of his
handsome daughter, an&#8217; secretly he
was believing in his heart that there
was none quite good enough to be a
husband for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just about the time I&#8217;m telling
ye of there began to be strange stories
floating around among the women-folks,
about a grand young man who wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
fine clothes an&#8217; seemed to have nothing
better to do than to hang around the
cottage and keep the girl I&#8217;m telling
ye of from doing her house-work.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been all right enough
most probably, an&#8217; spared a world of
trouble to all concerned, if she had
only been quite honest and spoken out
to her father, telling him about her
friend an&#8217; that he meant all fair an&#8217;
square by her. But girls is odd an&#8217;
shy in their ways sometimes, an&#8217; maybe
this girl was afraid her old father would
be angry, an&#8217; rough perhaps with the
young man, so she said never a word;
an&#8217; then one day when the old man
came home from his work rather earlier
than usual an&#8217; not feeling extra good-humored
as it happened, there was the
young man just as the neighbors had
said, a-sitting quite at home in the
cottage, painting away on a bit of cloth
stretched on a frame, an&#8217; it took only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
half an eye to see that it was a picture
of the girl he was making. Well, then
there was a great row, the old man
accusing his daughter of deceiving him,
an&#8217; calling the young man some rather
unhandsome names; but I must say he
kept his temper very well until the
girl began to cry an&#8217; her father said
something foolish about young gentlemen
making love to simple village
girls an&#8217; breaking their hearts for their
own amusement. At that the young
painter turned very white, an&#8217; quick as
a flash he walked straight over to the
girl an&#8217; putting his arm around her
waist he said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t cry, dear, an&#8217;
listen to me, for in your father&#8217;s presence
I ask you to become my wife as
soon as the minister can say the words.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; so they were married, these
two, an&#8217; now, my girl, you must tell the
rest. I know it is hard for you to do it,
but I cannot bring my tongue to it.&#8221;</p>

Philip&#8217;s Father</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BUT she did not go on for full
five minutes, and there was no
sound in the room but the crackling of
the fire and the ticking of the clock on
the mantel-shelf. Dash was the first to
break the silence, which even he seemed
to find oppressive; he got up from his
place under the table, and coming over
to Mag, gravely put his two paws in
her lap and looked up into her face in
a coaxing way he had when he wanted
something; it was an appeal which
Mag never resisted, and she patted him
gently on the head, saying, &#8220;Good
doggie! Lie down here, by the fire
where it is warm, an&#8217; I will try and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
tell Philip more about the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.</p>

<p>&#8220;His name was Philip; it&#8217;s right ye
should know that much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same as mine,&#8221; said the boy;
&#8220;that&#8217;s strange. What was the name
of the lass?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind a name for her,&#8221; said
grandfather hastily.</p>

<p>Mag went on as if she had not heard
the question:</p>

<p>&#8220;He worked for his wife, Philip did,
with the paints, an&#8217; made pictures to
send up to London to be sold, an&#8217; the
next year when the baby came, an&#8217;
there was more money needing, he
worked harder than ever, till he was
worn like a shadow. He was very sad
and quiet them times, with the weight
that was on him of caring for a family,
and him not reared with even the
thoughts of earning his own living.
She, the wife, never noticed how the toil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
was wearing on him; she wasn&#8217;t much
more than a child, an&#8217; when he grew so
still and weary-like, she fretted for the
pleasant words and free-hearted laugh
that used to be like music to her.
Then she&#8217;d scold him, with the evil
tongue she had, when things went
against her liking, an&#8217; he bore every
word like a saint. Once when the
money was lacking entirely, an&#8217; she
hadn&#8217;t the patience to wait for the payment
he was looking for from London,
she turned on him worse than ever;
an&#8217; when he couldn&#8217;t be driven to make
her an answer, she grew more bitter
and ugly, till at last she told him if he
was like other men he&#8217;d go down to
work in the mine. She was frightened
after she said it, for it was like an insult
to liken a born gentleman to them
rough miners; but he made no answer
even to that, only just got up from his
chair an&#8217; walked out of the house, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
following him to the very door an&#8217;
flinging rough words after him to the
last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave it now, Mag,&#8221; implored the
old man, who, to Philip&#8217;s amazement,
had been shaking his head and groaning
during his daughter&#8217;s rapidly spoken
narrative.</p>

<p>But Mag went on again as if she had
not noticed the interruption. This time,
however, she spoke with an effort, as if
the words were dragged from her by a
force she could not resist.</p>

<p>&#8220;The foolish woman repented her of
all her wicked words as soon as she lost
sight of him at the turn of the road,
but the pride an&#8217; temper that was in
her kept her back from going after him.
The thought wouldn&#8217;t leave her the day
through, that the jibes of her had sent
him off to his hurt in some way, an&#8217; she
wasn&#8217;t greatly astonished, but her heart
was grieved awful, when one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
neighbors told her that she&#8217;d seen her
husband going down the shaft.</p>

<p>&#8220;When it comes near night she took
up the baby an&#8217; walked over to the
mine, ready to throw herself on her
knees to Philip before them all when
he come up out of it, an&#8217; beg him to
forgive the temper of her that drove him
to take her at her words an&#8217; go down to
seek for work that was ill-fitting a gentleman.
There was a crowd coming
over from the shaft, early as it was,
an&#8217; as she come nearer she saw some of
the men carrying one between them that
looked, by the way the hands hung, as
if he had no life in him. There was
no need to tell her who it was, there
was no call to tell her how it happened,
for she knew that it was Philip before
they brought him a step nearer. It
was no use for the women to come
around to comfort her, to tell her &#8217;twas
an accident that took the life that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
a hundred times better worth saving
than her own. Her heart told her
&#8217;twas herself killed him by the rage
that drove him to take her at her word,
an&#8217; it turned to lead in her bosom, an&#8217;
ever since she has waited for the
punishment that is coming, for she
knows that her life will be taken as his
was. The same way that others long
for life, she longs for death; an&#8217; she
dare not take her life with her own
hands, or many a time she would have
done it, for waiting an&#8217; waiting is a part
of her punishment, an&#8217; she will shirk
none of it. But, oh! it&#8217;s a weary,
weary life, an&#8217; it takes patience to bear
it.&#8221; She rose at the last words, which
were uttered in a sort of moan, and,
opening the cottage door, walked out
into the cloudy darkness, which was
not even lighted by stars. Philip,
excited by her strange manner and the
story he had heard, sprang up as if to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
follow her, but his grandfather stopped
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;er be, lad,&#8221; he said; &#8220;she
goes out often that way nights after
you are sleeping, an&#8217; she comes back the
better for it, so I never try to hinder
her. That was a hard story for her to
tell, an&#8217; I&#8217;d spared her if she&#8217;d let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did she tell it, an&#8217; why did
she say I must hear it sometime?&#8221;
asked Philip, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was folly in her, sheer folly,&#8221; was
the answer. &#8220;But she had the notion
to tell thee; an&#8217; now it is said, thee needs
to think no thought about it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But did I ever see the lass?&#8221; persisted
the boy curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If thee did, thee wouldn&#8217;t know it,&#8221;
was the unsatisfactory answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she was a rare one to save
the men that time,&#8221; said Philip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, was she, true enough,&#8221; said the
old man proudly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>&#8220;What became of the baby?&#8221; asked
Philip.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the day,&#8221; said his grandfather,
&#8220;that they took the dead body of
her husband out of the door to bury him,
the poor young widow went down to the
mine to work along with the men, an&#8217;
till the boy was old enough to run she
took him on her back with her, tied in
a big shawl. She has a strange notion
that she is to meet a violent death down
there, the same as her man did. Some
folks say she&#8217;s crazed with the trouble;
but however it is, no one can put her
off from believing that, sooner or later,
her life must go to pay for his.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip was deeply moved by what he
had heard, and very gradually he began
to understand that the story was a true
one, and that it concerned him and his
parents very closely; his mother had
come in and resumed her drooping attitude
before the fire, and presently he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
went timidly over to her and laid his
cheek close to hers. &#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said
softly, &#8220;I think I can guess who the brave
girl was who saved the men&#8217;s lives, and,
mother dear, if my father loved her so
very much, would he lay it up against
her that she spoke a bit too quickly just
that once?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a quick cry Mag gathered her
little boy into her arms, breaking into
sobs and tears which were the relief her
sad heart needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, father!&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;to
think he knows it all, an&#8217; yet he does
not hate his poor, wicked mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried Philip, weeping too.
&#8220;I love ye more than ever, my own
dear mother, an&#8217; I mean to try and fill
my father&#8217;s place, an&#8217; take such good
care of ye, mother dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravely spoken, little lad,&#8221; said
grandfather, his brown wrinkled face
beaming satisfaction on the group by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fire. &#8220;I always told ye, Mag, that
&#8217;twould be far better the boy should be
told, an&#8217; besides he had a right to know
about his father, who was a real gentleman,
an&#8217; one for his son to be proud of,
though I may be a little late in saying
so, God forgive me! You see I was so
over-fond of your mother, boy, that if
an angel from heaven had wanted to
marry her I would have thought him
scarce good enough; an&#8217; then, too, I had
a foolish pride about our being such
ignorant folks, an&#8217; he so learned and
able to paint all them wonderful pictures,
that I was feared he&#8217;d feel scorn
of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man sighed penitently, and
Mag laid her hand lovingly on his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not deny ye was a little hard
on my husband,&#8221; she said tremulously,
&#8220;but it was all meant kindly enough,
an&#8217; as my little Philip said just now,
perhaps <i>now</i> he understands it all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; said Philip softly,
patting her cheek.</p>

<p>After that Mag talked more freely to
the boy of his father, and indeed it
seemed to afford her both relief and
pleasure to speak at last upon a subject
which had so long lain heavily on her
heart. She told Philip of her first meeting
with the handsome young artist, who
was staying then in the neighborhood at
a large house now vacant, which Philip
remembered to have seen on a memorable
visit to a neighboring town, and
which belonged to the family of his
father&#8217;s dearest friend and college chum,
Frederick Ashden. The two friends
had come to Ashden for the summer
vacation, and Philip Norton, who had
really a marked talent for painting,
was quite enraptured with the opportunities
for sketching which he found in
the picturesque mining village.</p>

<p>It was in the course of one of his long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
rambles about the country in search of
subjects that the young artist had met
the handsome village girl, whose dark
beauty he at once proceeded to transfer
to canvas. Mag was easily persuaded
to pose for a series of sketches which
prolonged their intercourse through
many a long summer afternoon, when
her father was away working in the
mine and the motherless girl was free
to do as she pleased. They were as
happy as birds, and with scarcely more
thought for the future; and then it was
that the neighbors began to shake their
heads, and to gossip about the handsome
gentleman who was far too fine for the
daughter of a poor miner. After a while
their hints and whisperings reached the
ears of the girl&#8217;s father&mdash;and the rest
we know.</p>

<p>But there was much that Philip did
not learn until long afterward, and which
even Mag did not understand, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
never more than dimly guessed that in
marrying her, Philip Norton had literally
given up everything which had
hitherto made his life worth living.
His parents had died when he was very
young, and he had been adopted by his
uncle and aunt, a childless couple who
had set their entire affections and hopes
upon their promising young nephew.
His hasty and unsuitable marriage had
wellnigh broken their hearts, and immediately
upon hearing of it they wrote
to him imploring him, as he was not
yet of age, to have the marriage annulled,
offering to settle a comfortable
allowance upon his wife if she would
consent to live apart from him. It is
needless to say that Philip Norton rejected
their offers with scorn, and as
they would not receive his wife, he
requested that in future all communications
between them should cease. His
monthly remittances, which were forwarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to him as usual, he returned
unopened, too proud to accept the aid
which he so sorely needed; for his
pictures sold but slowly and brought
pitifully small prices. Indeed, his
work at this time was sadly lacking in
inspiration, for he no longer worked
with the love of his art, which had once
been the motive power of his labor, but
with the painful effort born of a wearing
anxiety to earn the money which
should free him from the galling dependence
upon his hard-working father-in-law
which became day by day more
unbearable.</p>

<p>He felt keenly, too, the separation
from his friends, and especially did he
miss the companionship of Frederick
Ashden; yet he had himself insisted
upon a cessation of their intercourse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you will say of my
marriage,&#8221; he wrote to his friend, &#8220;and
as I do not wish to hear it from you, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
think it best that in future we should
not meet. Our paths in life will henceforth
diverge very widely. I have
chosen mine and am happy in the
choice; may yours be equally happy.
God bless you, and farewell!&mdash;Philip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mag realized in a dim way that her
husband had given up much in abandoning
his career and settling down to
the narrow life with her and her father
in their humble home; but, passionately
as she loved him, she was able to enter
into but few of his thoughts, and he
soon began sadly to realize this, and
many other things which he would
scarcely confess to himself. He was
harassed, too, by fears for the future;
Mag shared his anxiety, and then one
day she spoke the fatal words of
reproach which had driven her young
husband to his death, and for which
her life since that day had been one
long, vain regret.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>There was one thing which Philip
learned from his mother which troubled
him greatly. His father&#8217;s uncle and
adopted father, a clergyman, had, within
two years, received the appointment
to a neighboring parish, and shortly
after his arrival he had written very
kindly to Mag, as indeed he had done
before, begging that she would let
bygones be bygones, and allow him to
assist her in any way in his power,
especially in the education of her son.
Mag had treated this as she had done
the former offers, with silent disdain;
but when she told Philip he flushed
painfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure my father&#8217;s people meant
it kindly,&#8221; he said timidly, &#8220;and oh!
mother dear, if only they could know
ye I am sure that they would love
ye like everyone else.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mag stopped him almost angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Philip!&#8221; she said; &#8220;not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the whole world would I have those
proud people know what a poor,
humble, ignorant woman my Philip
had chosen for his wife. No, I will
not accept help from such as them; so
never speak of it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Philip, remorseful and abashed,
never did.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter VI<br />

A New Friend</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">PHILIP&#8217;S grandfather never regained
his strength after the attack of fever,
and he grew gradually more and more
feeble until at last he was not able to
leave his bed; and one morning when
Mag went softly into his room to see if
the old man needed her, she found that
he had passed quietly away during the
night.</p>

<p>It was a deep grief to his daughter,
but she had scarcely time to mourn for
her father, when Philip was stricken
down with the same fever, and for
many days he hovered between life
and death. The fever fed remorselessly
on his plump body, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
scarcely lost the rounded curves of
babyhood, and Mag felt something
tighten round her heart as she looked
at the wasted face upon the pillow.</p>

<p>The doctor, busy as he was, came
every day, for he knew something of
Mag&#8217;s sad history, and had a warm
place in his heart for her and her little
boy; and when the fever broke at last,
and he could say, &#8220;The worst is over
now, and the little lad will pull through
after all, please God,&#8221; his eyes were
moist with pleasure and relief, and as
he gathered up the reins to hurry on to
his next case, he muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish the Rev. Henry Seldon and
his wife could see that fine child and
his mother; I believe they would have
a mild surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip came out from his sick-room
a pale and languid image of his former
self; he had grown considerably taller,
as often happens in such cases, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
face had gained a certain delicate refinement
of expression which caused even
the rough miners to turn and look after
him admiringly, as in the early spring
days he began to walk about a little
with Dash in the warm sunshine.</p>

<p>The good doctor had peremptorily
forbidden that he should return to work
in the mines, and this was a great disappointment
to Philip, who was anxious
to help his mother with his earnings.
Nevertheless he could not deny that it
was extremely pleasant to wander about
the country with Dash, in the sweet
spring weather, spending long, blissful
days in the woods and fields, sometimes
returning home only just in time to
have the fire kindled and the kettle
boiling against Mag&#8217;s return from her
work in the mines.</p>

<p>One beautiful day in May, when Mag
was not to be expected home until later
than usual, Philip and Dash started off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
as they often did, for a long, happy day
in the country. Philip had their dinner
in a small basket which was slung over
his shoulder, while in one pocket he
was careful to put one of his beloved
books, and in the other a flute which
had been given him by his kind friend
the overseer, and upon which he had
taught himself to play very sweetly.</p>

<p>It was the boy&#8217;s greatest delight to
find a secluded spot somewhere in the
woods, where he could practise on
his flute without fear of interruption;
and after a rather longer search than
usual, Dash and he found such a nook
on this particular morning. In the course
of their tramp they had come quite unexpectedly
upon a small but beautiful
lake, and Philip gave a little cry of
delight as he pushed aside the bushes
and discovered the sheet of water sparkling
and dimpling in the sunlight. Dash
expressed his pleasure by diving into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the water for a swim, and Philip amused
himself for some time by throwing sticks
into the lake for the dog to bring
ashore in his mouth. After a while,
however, they both became conscious
of being pleasantly tired and hungry,
and then Philip opened the basket
which Mag had packed so carefully in
the morning, and dined royally on its
contents, with refreshing draughts of
clear, cool water from the lake. After
sharing the meal Dash curled himself
up on the grass for a comfortable nap,
while Philip took out his flute, and,
stretched on his back on a soft bed of
moss under the pleasant shade of a
great tree, he began to play.</p>

<p>At first the music was very soft and
sweet, with here and there a detached
note of silvery clearness; it seemed as
if the lovely, wordless improvisation
told in music of the mimic life of fairyland.
Shrill sweet cries of tiny sprites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
summoning each other to dance within
the circle of a fairy ring appeared to be
answered by an airy, invisible crowd,
and one could easily imagine he heard
the sound of tripping feet and rippling
laughter. Presently the gossamer host,
it might be fancied, fluttered about and
danced with a kind of soft gayety, like
the whirling of dry leaves on the mossy
ground when light breezes stir them.
All this, and the sound of flying feet,
gently clapping hands, and the light
swish of elfin robes were expressed,
perhaps unconsciously to himself, in
the varying strains that breathed from
Philip&#8217;s flute.</p>

<p>Then the boy paused for a moment
to take breath, and in an instant the
fairy crew vanished as suddenly as they
had come, and there was no sound but
the murmur of the wind among the
trees and the soft lapping of water.
Then Philip put his flute again to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
lips, and now&mdash;hark! A bird, high up
in the branches over his head, called
sweetly to its mate; at first very softly
and as though sleepily, and then, as the
clear notes of the flute cut more sharply
into the still afternoon air, his glad torrent
of sound filled the green forest
with joyous melody. If any others
than Dash (who was fast asleep) had
been there to listen, they would doubtless
have looked curiously among the
branches overhead, expecting every
moment to see the flashing of a feathered
breast or wing. Once again Philip
paused to unpurse his lips, and this time
a slight sound of rippling water behind
him caused him to turn his head;
and great was his surprise to see a
small, gayly painted boat drawn up
close to the bank on which he lay,
and it was the sound of oars, dipped
gently now and then into the water
to keep the boat from drifting away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
which had attracted the boy&#8217;s attention.
Dash awoke almost at the same
moment, with a sleepy bark of inquiry,
and Philip sprang at once to
his feet, flushed and embarrassed.</p>

<p>There was a gentleman in the boat,
and Philip remarked at a glance that
he was very tall and distinguished-looking,
in spite of the fact that he was
dressed in a careless, nglig fashion,
and that he was browned as though
from much exposure to the air and
sun. He gave one the impression,
somehow, of being in not quite perfect
health, in spite of his coat of tan; and
his handsome mouth had a downward
droop under its brown mustache which
gave his face an expression of weariness.
His eyes, however, were full of
amusement as he looked at Philip, and
he smiled reassuringly, reaching up as
he sat in the boat to seize a low-growing
limb by which to steady himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&#8220;I am afraid I have interrupted the
concert,&#8221; he said pleasantly, in a deep,
musical voice. &#8220;Perhaps you will
think it was not quite fair to have crept
up upon you unawares, but the music
of your flute drew me from away
across the lake, and I confess that I approached
as quietly as possible, fearing
that the delicious sounds might cease.
You play with rare skill, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip flushed with pleasure to be
thus praised by the handsome stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do ye really mean it, sir?&#8221; he
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, indeed,&#8221; said the gentleman;
&#8220;and may I ask who has been your
teacher?&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip shook his head. &#8220;No one,
sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have just picked it
up myself at odd moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gentleman whistled softly and
looked at the boy keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A veritable infant prodigy,&#8221; he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
half to himself; and then aloud, with a
twinkle in his eye:</p>

<p>&#8220;That little dog of yours looks at
me a trifle suspiciously. What can I
do to establish his confidence in the
honesty of my intentions? Here, jump
into my boat, both of you, and we will
go off for a little row; it will do us all
good, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dash did indeed hesitate for a
moment before trusting himself in the
stranger&#8217;s boat, but when Philip jumped
in eagerly and whistled for him to follow,
he seemed to think it must be all
right and sprang in after him. The
stranger pulled out into the lake with
long, strong strokes, which Philip
watched with a boy&#8217;s admiration for
manly strength and comeliness; he was
too happy to say very much, but he
lost no detail of the beauty of the scene,
and the oarsman watched the swift
changes of the boy&#8217;s delicate, expressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
face with keen intentness and real
pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get your eyes, my
boy?&#8221; he asked suddenly; and Philip
started and blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t know, sir,&#8221; he said shyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course you do not,&#8221; said the
other, laughing. &#8220;I only asked for the
sake of asking, and because I once saw
just such a pair in the head of a dear
friend, long since dead, poor fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed and frowned a little, and
in an instant Philip&#8217;s shyness vanished
in a warm rush of sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so sorry!&#8221; he said; &#8220;was
it somebody ye loved very much,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>The gentleman looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, indeed, my little man.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, as though to quit a painful
subject, he said abruptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell me about your music. I
play a little myself sometimes, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
is just possible that I might be able to
help you in some way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip clasped his hands ecstatically,
and then, encouraged by his listener&#8217;s
kindly interest, he chattered on quite
freely, of himself, of his mother and
their life together in the little cottage
at the mines, of their underground work,
and of his own anxiety to learn to read
and to play; and then, quite suddenly,
he broke off, reminded by the lengthening
shadows of the trees that the afternoon
had nearly worn away, that Dash
and he had a long walk ahead of them,
and that Mag might even then be watching
anxiously for their return.</p>

<p>So the boat was turned about again,
and when the stranger had set the boy
and his dog on shore, he held out his
hand with real regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, my boy,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you
have done more than you know this
afternoon. Will you come again
soon?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; said Philip eagerly; &#8220;and
I believe I shall never forget this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said the other earnestly;
&#8220;and now, let me see: this is Monday,
is it not? Why cannot Dash and
you come over again on Thursday for
another row, and perhaps some fishing
in the lake,&#8221; and as Philip would have
thanked him for the invitation&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, &#8220;no thanks, please;
but come on Thursday. And, by the
way, what is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Philip,&#8221; said the boy simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good name,&#8221; said the gentleman,
&#8220;and one I like&mdash;for many reasons.
And my name&mdash;is Frederick.&#8221; He
laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;ll remember it, I hope?
And now, good-by, Philip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, Frederick,&#8221; said the
boy, and as his new friend pushed
off from the shore, he scampered
away through the woods towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
home, with Dash following closely at
his heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother dear!&#8221; said Philip, as
he was going to bed that night, after
having talked all the evening about his
adventure and his new friend, &#8220;oh,
mother dear, I wish to-morrow was
going to be Thursday!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mag smiled indulgently at her
boy&#8217;s enthusiasm; but, alas! before the
Thursday came, events had occurred
which were destined to change quite
entirely our little Philip&#8217;s history, and
which, among other things, were to prevent
his keeping his appointment with
his new-found friend.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter VII<br />

A Mining Tragedy</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WITHIN doors at the pretty Lowdown
Rectory everything was
even more brightly cheerful than usual
for the contrast with the dismal storm
outside. The breakfast table, with all
its elegant appointments, was waiting in
the oak dining-room, and at one of the
windows in the same room was a group
of young girls waiting, too, for their
elders to be ready for breakfast. But
they were not early risers at the rectory,
and it was nearly ten o&#8217;clock before
the family and their guests assembled
around the table. Mr. Seldon, the old
rector, and his wife lived quite alone,
but once every year their quiet household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
was enlivened by a visit from their
nephew and his wife and children.</p>

<p>The party had arrived only the day
before, and the children were lamenting
the storm that seemed likely to keep
them in the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s much of a hardship
to stay in such a lovely house as
this,&#8221; said their mother, looking around
the pleasant room and smiling at Aunt
Delia, who laughed and nodded back
from behind the urn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the house is jolly, and so is
aunty,&#8221; said Marion, the oldest girl;
&#8220;but I want to run out and see the
ponies and talk with Jim, and take a
look at the peacocks and feed the
rabbits, and do a thousand things that
the rain won&#8217;t let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand is a large number,&#8221;
said her father quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is, but I&#8217;ll give up the whole
thousand if you&#8217;ll take me down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the mine. Papa, I ask you every time
we come to see Uncle Seldon, but you
never do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Norton looked uncomfortable,
glanced at his uncle, who seemed to
avoid his eye, and then at his aunt, who,
on the contrary, fixed her eyes on his
very expressively and sadly, while her
lips parted as if she were about to say
something. Mrs. Norton kept her attention
steadily fixed upon her plate,
but the color rushed to her face, and
she, too, looked ill at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what have I said?&#8221; said
Marion, who was something of a
spoiled child. &#8220;One would think I
had done something out of the way.
You all look as displeased as Miss
Hiller does when I wipe my pen on
my pocket-handkerchief or get a blot
on the copy-book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If such are your habits, I don&#8217;t
wonder your mamma has had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
change your governesses so often,&#8221; said
the rector, seizing the opportunity to
change the subject and keep the conversation
in his own hands for a few
moments.</p>

<p>But Marion might have found an
opportunity to repeat her question, had
it not been for an occurrence which
gave them something else to think of.
Peter, the privileged old butler, whose
own mother had been the rector&#8217;s nurse,
and who consequently felt himself to be
one of the family, came running into the
room without the toast he had been
sent for, and, without waiting to be
questioned as to his singular behavior,
exclaimed, lapsing into the speech of
his earlier years:</p>

<p>&#8220;Maister! maister! There&#8217;s been a
falling-in at the mines, and Joe Short
he have been up to say there&#8217;s been
men buried under, an&#8217; the superintendent&#8217;s
down with &#8217;em, and there&#8217;s no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
about giving any orders worth taking,
an&#8217; he says the skreeling of the women
is fit to turn the head of one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must have been some carelessness
with uncovered lamps,&#8221; said
the rector, rising instantly. &#8220;Bring
my coat, Peter, and get ready to come
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going with you, too,&#8221; said Dr.
Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will follow as soon as I
can prepare some bandages in case
they should be wanted,&#8221; said Mrs.
Norton, &#8220;and some brandy, if Aunt
Delia will give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How very thoughtful you are,
Grace!&#8221; the rector stopped a moment
to say. &#8220;If you are willing to come
over, you might, perhaps, comfort the
poor women who will be waiting in
agony to know if their husbands and
sons are living or dead. But can you
bear it, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8220;I can answer for her,&#8221; said her husband.
&#8220;Grace is a surgeon&#8217;s daughter
and a surgeon&#8217;s wife, and, delicate as
she looks, has nerve enough to be a
surgeon herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Mrs. Norton
joined her husband and his uncle at the
scene of the disaster. There had been
an explosion of fire-damp, and eight
or ten more or less severely injured
men had been brought up. Others
were buried under the fallen wall of
the gallery in which the accident
occurred, and all the workmen were
doing their best to dig them out. The
distress of those who feared the worst
for their friends was terrible, and Mrs.
Norton turned pale as she went through
the crowd to her husband&#8217;s side. Her
arrival was most opportune, and for
hours she was actively engaged in
assisting him and trying to give some
consolation to the women. The overseer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was not, as they feared, one of the
missing, nor was he even hurt, but was
directing the work of rescue below.</p>

<p>At last, after eight hours of digging,
word was sent up that they had hopes
of speedily reaching those who were
buried. Their shouts had been feebly
answered, so some at least were still
living. It grew dark and late into the
night before they were reached, but
not one of the party from the rectory
would leave the vicinity of the mine.</p>

<p>Old Peter, who had been travelling
back and forth all day, brought over a
basket of provisions and spread supper
for them in one of the miners&#8217; huts.
They were all so thoroughly exhausted
that they found it a most welcome
repast, and it was fortunate they had
taken it, for almost before it was finished
Dr. Norton was summoned again
to the shaft.</p>

<p>They had brought up five men,&mdash;two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of whom were dead and the others
nearly unconscious&mdash;a woman, and a
boy. Mrs. Norton, already overcome
with the labor and excitement of the
day, felt for a moment that she could
not endure the sight of more suffering,
but hearing that a woman was among
the victims, she hesitated no longer, and
ran quickly to the shaft. She found her
husband bending over a woman who
had been laid upon a plank covered
with quilts, preparations for carrying
the sufferers having been made hours
before. She was so motionless that
they were all sure she was dead, but as
the doctor raised his head he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;She is alive. Take her to her
house and I will follow you instantly.
Leave her on the board till I come
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he turned to examine the others
by the light of the lanterns, but Mrs.
Norton followed the men who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
carrying the woman. They took her
into a little hut, no different from all the
other houses about, and there they
waited as the doctor had asked them to
do, keeping her still on the plank. She
groaned slightly then, and Mrs. Norton
moistened her lips with something she
carried in a bottle, but the woman did
not seem to be conscious.</p>

<p>Her back was broken, the doctor said
upon examination, and she was not conscious
of suffering, and probably never
would be again. So they laid her upon
the bed, and Dr. Norton asked his wife
to leave her to his care, with the assistance
of some women who had come in
with him, and go to the house where
they had taken the boy. He had not
been working in the mine, it seemed,
but had gone down to carry a message
before the explosion occurred; he was
not injured in any way, but was prostrated
by partial suffocation. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Norton was quite equal to the simple
treatment necessary in his case, and
after beef tea and stimulants had been
administered, a little color began to
creep into his face, and he asked feebly
for his mother.</p>

<p>The woman on whose bed he was
lying shook her head warningly, and
Mrs. Norton understood from her gesture
that the woman who lay dying in
the house near by was his mother.
Her heart ached for the poor boy, and,
putting her soft cheek close to his,
she petted and soothed him as if he had
been a child of her own, whispering to
him that he must be very still and not
ask to see his mother till morning. He
was still very weak and seemed to forget
that he had asked for any one, and
soon dropped asleep with his hand so
tightly clasping hers that she feared to
withdraw it.</p>

<p>And there she was, sitting silently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
by his side and studying the pale face,
from which she had washed the grimy
dust it was covered with at first, and
brushed back the thick, fair, waving
hair, when the rector came in, and,
after looking attentively at the boy
for a moment, took a seat by her
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace,&#8221; he said, having first sent
the woman of the house out of the
room on some trifling errand, &#8220;do you
know who this boy&#8217;s mother is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard them speak of her as
Mag, uncle, but I do not know of any
other name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is the wife of your husband&#8217;s
brother Philip, Grace, and this boy is
his son; but she is dying now, and
all the hard feelings we had toward
her in the past must be forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, uncle, I have always wished
to see her; but how dreadful that it
should be in this way! Let me go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
her now. I can leave this child in old
Dorothy&#8217;s care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I want you to go to her if you
are willing,&#8221; said the rector. &#8220;She is
anxious to see her boy, and we have
promised to take him to her when he
awakes. George says she will probably
live a number of hours yet. She
suffers no pain, and is quite conscious
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is there no hope of saving
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None whatever,&#8221; answered her
uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she know she must die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and she seems to have no
desire to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor woman! What a sad life that
must be which one is so willing to
leave!&#8221; said Mrs. Norton, who had
been gently withdrawing her hand
from the close clasp of little Philip&#8217;s,
and getting ready to go with her uncle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>They found Mag in a dull, heavy
sleep, from which Dr. Norton said she
would awake again; and she did, at
short intervals, all through the night.
As morning dawned, she awoke more
fully and asked for a drink. A miner
with a sorrowful face brought it in a
cup, which Mrs. Norton took from him
and held to her lips. She drained it,
and then, looking at the tender, pitying
eyes fixed on hers, said fretfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;What brings a leddy here to look
at me? Take her away and bring my
boy. And who&#8217;s yon?&#8221; she asked
half fearfully, as Dr. Norton came
across the room and laid his finger on
her pulse.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Dr. Norton,&#8221; said his wife
gently; &#8220;your Philip&#8217;s brother, you
know; and he is doing all he can to
make you comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Norton!&#8221; said the dying woman,
in a strange, awe-struck whisper. &#8220;It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was him, then, that told me &#8217;twas a
death-blow I&#8217;d gotten, when I asked
him in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I take him out?&#8221; whispered
the rector, thinking his presence troubled
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, let him be,&#8221; said Mag, her
voice husky now, but as strong and
steady as if the chill of death were not
already creeping over her. &#8220;Let him
stay. I&#8217;m fair glad to have him see me
lie here broken and mangled the way I
am. I don&#8217;t ask him to forgive me, but
happen it will be a comfort to him to
see the one that sent his brother to his
death taken the same way herself.
Oh, if I had only died long ago, before
I brought grief to them all!&#8221;</p>

<p>Long ago, when Philip Norton, who
had married a girl very far beneath him,
met with his violent death, his brother
had said that he never could forgive
the woman who had been the means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
bringing such unutterable misery upon
Philip and all who loved him. But as
he looked down on her now, all bitterness
and malice faded out of Dr. Norton&#8217;s
heart, and he assured her in
earnest, broken words of his entire
forgiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good words,&#8221; she murmured, so
low this time that Mrs. Norton, kneeling
by her side, could hardly catch
them; &#8220;good words to hear. Maybe
if he can forgive me, the Lord will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed He will,&#8221; sobbed Mrs. Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think He will?&#8221; said Mag
earnestly. She had no power to move
her neck, but she turned her eyes
eagerly to the speaker. &#8220;I heard it
said once, a life &#8217;ill be asked for a life.
My life&#8217;s poor pay for one like Philip&#8217;s.
I never was one to know much about
church an&#8217; praying, but I&#8217;ve asked in a
rough sort of way if He would take my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
life of me if I could have patience to
wait till He was ready, for many&#8217;s the
time I&#8217;ve longed to put an end to it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She slept again after the doctor had
given her a stimulant, and her son was
brought in. He was weak and pale,
and Mrs. Norton held him while the
rector tried, as gently as possible, to
explain his mother&#8217;s condition to him.
He received all that was told him so
quietly that it was evident the shock
and exhaustion of the accident kept him
from fully understanding the words.</p>

<p>Again Mag opened her eyes, and
this time they fell upon her child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor lad!&#8221; she whispered; &#8220;he
was always so fond of his poor mother,
and I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;ll care for him
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Mrs. Norton quickly.
&#8220;I am his Aunt Grace, and if you will
trust me I will try to take your place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
with him. And I will not let him forget
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mag&#8217;s face darkened with the look of
gloomy reserve that it had worn for so
many years.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must forget me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if
he&#8217;s to be with his father&#8217;s people.
The very thought of me would keep
him from being fit for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him to us,&#8221; said Dr. Norton,
who had exchanged a few whispered
words on the subject with his wife while
Mag slept, &#8220;and we will educate and
rear him as Philip&#8217;s child should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the rector, who had been
weeping silently while they spoke,
&#8220;give him to me, that I may have the
opportunity of repairing my neglect of
him and you. I have not realized till
now the duty I have owed you both.
Philip was like a darling son to us, and
his boy will take his place in our
hearts. I can speak for my wife, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
she has urged me to do this before,
though I was wicked enough not to
heed her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mag had watched them all keenly.
&#8220;Let him be Philip over again if ye can
make him so, and do with him as ye
please,&#8221; she said, not making any decision
as to which of his relatives should
take him. She lay quite still for some
time after that with her eyes closed,
and when she opened them again
she looked about fearfully as though
alarmed at the sight of so many strange
faces. &#8220;If the ladies and gentlemen
wouldn&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she said, &#8220;could I
have just a word alone with my little
lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>In tearful silence they all left the
room, but through the thin partition
they could hear Mag&#8217;s low voice growing
gradually fainter until it ceased altogether,
and the sound of Philip&#8217;s
heart-broken sobbing filled the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Mrs. Norton stole quietly in, and kneeling
beside the bed gathered the boy
gently in her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, mother, whatever will I
do without ye?&#8221; he sobbed; and the old
clergyman, coming in at this moment,
laid his hand on the boy&#8217;s fair curls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray God to forgive me for having
so long neglected that noble woman,&#8221;
he said solemnly, &#8220;and with His help I
will try to be a father to her boy.&#8221;</p>

A Great Change</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the victims of the disaster
had been buried in the village
churchyard, Philip bade farewell to
the little cottage which he had called
home, and a great lump gathered in his
throat as he turned from the scene of so
many happy days, realizing that the
past was now a closed book, and that
he belonged henceforth to his father&#8217;s
people. He lay back listlessly in the
carriage beside Mrs. Norton, his eyes
closed, and a great round tear rolling
now and then down his pale, sad little
face. Dash, who was his greatest comforter,
lay snuggled up close beside him
on the seat, his watchful eyes fastened<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
intently on his young master, whose
grief he seemed fully to understand and
appreciate. Mrs. Norton said but little
to the sorrowful boy, but she made
him as comfortable as possible with
cushions and shawls, and once or twice
she pressed his hand with tender sympathy.
There had been some discussion
as to where Philip&#8217;s home should
be henceforth, but Aunt Delia had
urged her claim for her dear dead
nephew&#8217;s boy so warmly that it was
decided that for the present at least he
should stop at the rectory.</p>

<p>The surprise of Marion Norton and
her sisters was unbounded when they
had heard as much of Philip&#8217;s story as
it was thought best to tell them, and
great was their curiosity to see this new
cousin, of whose existence, even, they
had never heard before, and who was
suddenly to be introduced to the
family circle. They held many discussions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
among themselves concerning
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is just about your age,&#8221; said
Marion to Rose and Lillie, her two
younger sisters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he is eleven,&#8221; said Rose, with
dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but what do you think?
Peter says he does not know how to
read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How very stupid he must be!&#8221;
remarked Rose, with an air of superior
knowledge. &#8220;I shall not play with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But mamma said we must be kind
to him,&#8221; said Lillie, &#8220;and love him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be kind to him of course,&#8221;
said Marion; &#8220;but I can never love
him, because I consider him a disgrace
to the family. I am so thankful that he
is to live here instead of with us, as
mamma thought at first that he might
do. I wouldn&#8217;t have people in town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
know that we had such a relative for
the whole world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose was much impressed by
Marion&#8217;s sentiments, but Lillie looked
troubled. Her mother had told them
that the little orphan was sick and sad,
and her tender heart ached for him.
He had been carried into the house
and straight to the little room which
Aunt Delia had prepared for him next
her own; but Dr. Norton did not
think him well enough to see his young
cousins yet; so Lillie begged a little
nosegay from the gardener, and,
arranging it herself with the greatest
care, sent it to him by Peter, charging
him to say that one of his little cousins
sent it with her love. For several days
the graceful act was repeated, and
Philip, lying on the lounge in his
pretty little room, learned to watch
and wait eagerly for the daily token
of this unknown cousin&#8217;s thoughtfulness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
He endured no pain, but suffered
greatly from nervous prostration caused
by the great shock he had undergone.
For hours he would lie with his eyes
closed, and so still that Aunt Delia
thought him sleeping; but his brain
was active, and at such times he was
thinking of his past life, and of the
strange, hardly to be understood change
in his circumstances.</p>

<p>He had been provided with clothes
befitting his new condition in life, and
when, after a few days&#8217; confinement to
his bed, he was able to put them on
and lie on the lounge, Aunt Delia
wanted to bring the little girls in to
make his acquaintance; but the proposal
threw him into an agony of shy
terror. He was full of curiosity to see
them, but the idea of facing strangers
was insupportable; so his elder relatives
decided that it would be best to let
him have his own way for the present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hoping that, as he grew stronger, his
desire for solitude would disappear.</p>

<p>One day when Mrs. Norton, who
had been sitting by him, was called
away, he fell, according to his custom,
into one of his dreamy reveries, from
which he was startled by a sound so
wonderfully strange and sweet that
in his ecstatic surprise he thought he
must have died and gone to heaven.
Forgetting his shyness and weakness,
he rose from the sofa, and, following
the sound that attracted him, went
through several rooms to the drawing-room,
where Marion sat playing a
plaintive Scotch air upon the piano.</p>

<p>It was an old instrument and rather
out of tune, and Marion was not a skilful
performer; but to Philip&#8217;s ears the
music was heavenly. He had never
even heard of a piano, and the only instrument
besides his flute which he had
ever listened to was a violin cruelly ill-used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in the hands of one of the miners.
The genius which in his father had developed
into a talent for painting had in
Philip taken the form of a passion for
music, and now as the girl, unconscious
of a listener, played fragments of waltzes
and snatches of airs for her own amusement,
he sank upon his knees and buried
his face in the cushions of an easy-chair,
unable to stand, and scarce knowing
whether it was pain or pleasure that
thrilled through him and shook his
frame with convulsive sobs.</p>

<p>It was Aunt Delia&#8217;s voice that roused
him from his trance of emotion, and
startled Marion into the knowledge that
he was in the room. The dear old lady
had come in to see if it was by her
father&#8217;s permission that Marion was
playing, as hitherto the house had been
kept perfectly quiet on the invalid&#8217;s
account.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Marion dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
you sure the playing won&#8217;t disturb your
little cousin? But, dear, dear, what&#8217;s
this?&#8221; she exclaimed, almost falling
over Philip in the half-light of the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please,&#8221; said the boy, lifting a
tearful face, &#8220;don&#8217;t stop her, and do
please let me stay and hearken to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Aunt Delia saw that his strength
was gone, and was firm in insisting upon
helping him back to his room, where he
lay upon the lounge entirely overcome
by his effort and excess of emotion.</p>

<p>From that time he began to mend
rapidly, and instead of the dreary musings
that had absorbed him, memory fed
his poetic fancy with rapt recollections
of the wonderful harmony and the beautiful
young girl, like an angel she
seemed to him, who from the strange unmusical-looking
instrument drew such
wonderfully melodious sounds. He
begged so hard for more music that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
every day while they stopped with their
uncle the sisters played, and if it was
only the practice of their scales and
other exercises to which he listened,
his delight was unbounded.</p>

<p>He no longer resisted Aunt Delia&#8217;s
desire to make him acquainted with his
cousins, and so they were brought into
his room by their mother. Marion, to
gratify her curiosity, came eagerly when
first permitted, and being, in spite of
her mother&#8217;s wise training, excessively
fond of admiration, vastly enjoyed the
dazzled adoration of poor Philip for her
beauty and accomplishments. But after
the novelty of that wore off she began
to show some of the unlovely traits of
her nature, and to assume a cold and
forbidding manner toward her cousin,
who, she had decided on first learning
of his existence, was a disgrace to the
family.</p>

<p>Rose, who systematically copied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
her elder sister as nearly as possible,
followed her lead in her treatment
of Philip, and became, after the first,
cold and haughty to him in the same
proportion.</p>

<p>So it was left to Lillie to show him
how loving and lovable a cousin may
be. To atone for her sisters&#8217; slights,
which his utter ignorance of the world
kept him from fully comprehending,
she devoted every spare moment to
his amusement. She talked to him for
hours of her home and of the life she
and her sisters led there&mdash;of their
books, their studies, their amusements,
and every detail. It was like a fairy tale
to the boy&mdash;so much of whose short
life had been spent under-ground. His
lips were sealed about that dark past,
which some instinct of his sensitive
nature forbade his mentioning in the
new sphere in which he found himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would have been better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
if, instead of burying thoughts, feelings,
and experiences in his heart, he had
frankly thrown himself upon the sympathy
of his cousin Lillie, who, without
receiving any confidence from him, felt
the tenderest pity for the lonely orphan,
and tried in every way in her power to
make him forget the shadows that had
overcast his young life.</p>

<p>One day her mother and sisters had
gone to drive, leaving Lillie, by her own
request, to sit with Philip. She came
smilingly into his room after watching
the carriage drive off, but Philip was
not there.</p>

<p>Not much surprised, as lately he had
walked about the house when he felt
disposed, she sat down to wait for his
return. Presently she heard the piano
in the drawing-room touched gently
and uncertainly, as if by an unaccustomed
hand, then more confidently and
firmly, and at last with energy&mdash;not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
random, but harmoniously. She went
to the door, and from there, unseen by
him, she saw Philip seated at the instrument,
his head turned bird-like
upon one side, and his fingers actually
bringing music from the keys. As
she listened in surprise&mdash;for she knew
he was playing for the first time in his
life&mdash;she heard him say to himself, in
a half whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it sings for me! it sings for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not, as far as she could tell,
attempt any tune, but the notes that he
struck were in harmony, and in a sort
of cadence, very different from what
the usual performance of a child without
instruction would naturally be.</p>

<p>Astonished and almost frightened by
what she had heard, Lillie crept back
without having been seen, and went to
her aunt&#8217;s room to tell her of her surprise,
leaving the door ajar that she,
too, might hear the sounds that Philip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was making, unconscious that they fell
upon any ear but his own. They returned
together to the drawing-room.
It was some time before Philip noticed
their presence; when he did so he
stopped playing at once, his face crimson
with embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; said Aunt Delia,
putting her arm about him in a motherly
way she had, &#8220;I did not know the old
piano had so much music in it. You
must have a teacher, my Philip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Delia,&#8221; cried the boy,
with shining eyes, &#8220;do you suppose I
should ever be able to learn to play
like my cousin Marion?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Delia smiled at the boy&#8217;s simplicity.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you will undoubtedly
learn to play far better than
your cousin, but first you must grow
quite well and strong. What you need
now is to play and romp in the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
air. Let us make an agreement.
Peter has not time to attend properly
to my flower-garden. If you will dig
all the weeds out of my tulip-bed, I will
see if I cannot persuade your uncle to
have you taught to play the piano.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip&#8217;s answer was an ecstatic hug
which left the dear old lady quite out of
breath, and from that day the boy spent
all his spare time hoeing and digging
in the old-fashioned garden behind the
house; and very soon the pale, slender,
sickly-looking lad was transformed into
a brown, sturdy, long-legged boy whose
happy laugh mingled with the merry
voices of his cousins as they played
happily together in the old garden,
while Aunt Delia, watching them unobserved
from an upper window, would
follow him lovingly with her eyes,
saying: &#8220;How wonderfully like his
father the boy grows!&#8221;</p>

Trials and Pleasures</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE Philip had fully recovered
his health and strength, his uncle&#8217;s
family had left the rectory and returned
to their city home. The house was quiet
enough then, and Aunt Delia feared
that the boy would pine for his young
cousins; but it hardly seemed as if he
missed them. Although as long as
they had stayed they had been objects
of intense interest and admiration to
him, it was almost a relief to have them
go. The secret of this was the consciousness
of his own ignorance which
had been forced upon Philip by his
cousin Marion&#8217;s silly desire to exhibit
her own superior wisdom and accomplishments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
The foolish girl had shown
in so many ways her contempt for her
cousin&#8217;s lack of education that the boy
was quite unhappy in her presence, and
the sight of a book caused him the most
painful embarrassment. Aunt Delia,
too kind herself to think her niece capable
of wounding her cousin&#8217;s feelings,
was but dimly conscious of the poor
boy&#8217;s trouble of mind; indeed, she had
been so anxious that Philip&#8217;s health
should be firmly established that she
had purposely delayed making any
suggestions as to his settling down to
study, and the rector had quite agreed
to the wisdom of this delay. It was
not until after the Nortons had gone
that the dear old lady discovered the
trouble which was preying on the mind
of the sensitive child, whom she already
loved as though he had been her own
son.</p>

<p>Stepping into his room, one day, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a handsome volume of illustrated natural
history, the dear old lady put it in his
hands with the announcement that it
was full of nice pictures.</p>

<p>He took it with a grateful smile, but
tears which he could not control rushed
to his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, dearie, what is it?&#8221;
exclaimed kind Aunt Delia in amazement,
taking him in her arms as if he
had been a baby. &#8220;Is my boy fretting
for his cousins? Poor fellow, it is lonely
for you here with only the old folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; denied Philip emphatically,
&#8220;I want no one but you. I never
was used to young folks anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor boy!&#8221; said Aunt Delia, kissing
his pale, sad little face. &#8220;But you love
your little cousins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; was the reply in a half
whisper, as if it was almost irreverent
to confess to such a feeling toward
creatures so superior.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>&#8220;Well, a year seems long to look
forward to, but it soon passes by; and
before we know it next summer will
come, and then we shall have the girls
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip did not look as if the prospect
gave him joy, and his aunt saw with
puzzled surprise that it was so. She
would like to have asked him why, but
there was an odd, unchildlike reserve
about him which she felt a delicacy in
attempting to penetrate. To relieve
what seemed like embarrassment upon
his part, she dropped the subject and
again turned to the book, which had
not yet been opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; she said, &#8220;here are lions and
tigers, and all sorts of things that boys
love to look at.&#8221; To her surprise,
Philip pushed the book away and
suddenly threw his arms around his
aunt&#8217;s neck and buried his face on her
shoulder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Delia!&#8221; he whispered;
&#8220;I am so ashamed&mdash;a great boy like
me, and not able to read.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Aunt Delia saw it all in a
flash&mdash;the boy&#8217;s shy reserve with his
cousins, his embarrassment which at
times had puzzled and distressed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;and it
has troubled you so much that you are
a year or two behind the other children!
My poor foolish Philip!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has made me wish many a time
that I had never been born, or that my
mother had taken me with her when
she died,&#8221; murmured Philip, his hand
still on his aunt&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear, it is so easily remedied,
this terrible ignorance which has
made you so unhappy. Your uncle
and I have only been waiting until you
should be quite well and strong. But
we will not wait another day. You
shall have a governess as soon as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
can find one who will be willing to
undertake the education of such a silly,
stupid boy,&#8221; and she pinched his flushed
cheek with playful affection.</p>

<p>But Philip was not entirely reassured.</p>

<p>&#8220;A governess!&#8221; he said doubtfully.
&#8220;Oh, but that will be another person to
find out how ignorant I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how else in the world will you
ever learn?&#8221; asked Aunt Delia, smiling;
&#8220;and besides I thought you wanted to
study music, and the governess can
give you lessons on the piano as well,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The expression of doubt on Philip&#8217;s
face cleared instantly and he smiled
radiantly. &#8220;Oh, Aunt Delia,&#8221; he
cried, &#8220;it seems almost too good to be
true! Do you suppose I shall ever be
able to play like&mdash;like Marion?&#8221; And
Aunt Delia smiled, but wisely said
nothing. Only that same evening she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
nodded sagely when her husband remarked:
&#8220;My dear, that boy has certainly
a most remarkable talent for
music.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, indeed, he had, as well as
what might be called an extraordinary
musical memory. He remembered
every tune he had heard his cousin
play, and there was not one, even
among the most difficult, that he did
not pick out upon the old piano. Hesitatingly
at first, with his head bent in
the bird-like way that Lillie had noticed,
his fingers would wander over
the keys, touching the notes of the
remembered air, then striking them
with more assurance, and finally weaving
around the familiar tune strangely
sweet strains and chords. Listening
to him sometimes, in the long twilight,
Aunt Delia would find herself
wiping the dimness from her glasses,
and wondering at the strange power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
his untaught playing had to move her
as no other music ever did.</p>

<p>Philip dearly loved to have her for
a listener, for he knew his playing gave
her pleasure, and his deep gratitude for
her goodness to him made him rejoice
that there was even one thing he could
do to gratify her. They grew very
confidential in the quiet hours they
spent together, and Aunt Delia explored
her memory for half-forgotten stories
of her own youth, and once she was led
on by the boy&#8217;s rapt interest in all she
said to speak of the dear little children
the Lord had blessed her with for a
short time in her early married life,
and then taken to Himself. Philip
wept with her when she told of her
sorrow and loneliness, and when she
kissed him and called him the blessing
of her old age, his heart swelled with
proud pleasure at the thought of being
any comfort to one so dear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>It had been a thoughtful suggestion
of the rector&#8217;s that Philip should learn to
read under his aunt&#8217;s guidance until a
suitable teacher could be found, and
from the time of Aunt Delia&#8217;s promise
to teach him his health improved with
wonderful rapidity, and the perseverance
with which he devoted himself to
the task of learning to read seemed to
do him no harm, although his ambition
led him to spend every spare moment
over his books. He was so eager to
learn that Aunt Delia went on in spite
of her previous decision to teach him
only to read, and, almost before she
realized that she was doing it, found
herself instructing her enthusiastic pupil
in writing and most of the studies that
are given to boys of his age.</p>

<p>He was so charmed with his own
progress, and so radiantly happy to be
able to read nearly as well as his cousin
Lillie the books that she used to read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to him, that he half forgot his dread of
the impending governess with whom
he was threatened.</p>

<p>She came at last, but there was
nothing about her to frighten the most
timid child that ever lived. She was
the daughter of an old friend of the
family, who, dying in a state of almost
destitution, had left his daughters with
no capital but good health and fine education
for their future support. The
elder of them had written to ask Dr.
Norton&#8217;s advice about the steps to be
taken to secure positions for herself
and sister; and he, after consulting with
Aunt Delia, at once offered the situation
of governess to his nephew to whichever
of the young ladies should decide
to accept it.</p>

<p>The younger sister it was who came,
and so far from wearing the expression
of being a terror of evil-doers, her poor,
shy, frightened face and timid manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
showed so much embarrassment and
fear of strangers that Philip felt himself
quite brave by comparison, and,
instead of shrinking away from her,
actually found himself making shy little
attempts to make her feel at home.</p>

<p>Her diffidence wore off after a few
days, and then Miss Acton, the new
governess, won all hearts by her gentle,
lovable ways.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Philip, Miss Acton
had had a fine musical education, and
she took perfect delight in her scholar&#8217;s
application and talent.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is something wonderful,&#8221; she
said to Mrs. Seldon after her first quarter&#8217;s
lessons. &#8220;I can really teach him
nothing except the technicalities of
piano-playing. His interpretations of
certain passages surprise me, and I
believe that he will some day become
a truly great musician.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made great progress, too, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
lessons, spurred on by his desire to be
able to read well before the return of his
young cousins. When the sunshine out-of-doors
was particularly inviting, and
when Dash was showing his sympathy
with his young master&#8217;s impatience by
scratching and whining at the door,
Miss Acton had only to say, &#8220;I wonder
if Marion will think you have improved
in your reading, Philip,&#8221; to make him
go at his task again with redoubled
energy.</p>

<p>Dash did not approve of Philip&#8217;s
studious habits. Miss Acton had tried
excluding him from the school-room
altogether, but he was so unhappy and
would whine so piteously outside the
door that she was obliged to allow him
to return on a promise of good behavior.
Philip, too, had impressed upon him the
necessity of preserving order in the
school-room, and he soon came to understand
that when a person held a book he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
did not wish to be disturbed. One
morning Miss Acton was slightly indisposed,
and as there were to be no lessons
that day Philip wandered into the garden
after breakfast, instead of going as usual
directly to the school-room. Dash of
course followed closely at his heels, but
he seemed to think that something was
wrong, and several times he would walk
slowly toward the house, looking back
as much as to say, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
follow me? It&#8217;s school-time, you know,
Philip.&#8221; But Philip paid no attention,
and at last Dash trotted into the house
and up the stairs in a business-like manner.
Philip had just time to notice his
absence, and wonder at it, when he
returned, carrying something in his
mouth which he brought and laid at
Philip&#8217;s feet, barking joyously as though
pleased at his own cleverness. Philip
stooped to pick up the object which had
been dropped, and discovered that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was his copy-book, which Dash had
fetched from his desk in the school-room.</p>

<p>Miss Acton was much amused when
she learned of the occurrence, and declared
that hereafter Dash should be encouraged
to remain during the lessons.
&#8220;I am sure,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that if he could
only hold a pen he would be able to
write as well as Philip; and at any rate
such a dog is a valuable mentor for my
pupil.&#8221;</p>

Aunt Delia&#8217;s Secret</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE year made a great change in
Philip. He worked at his lessons
with gentle Miss Acton with such
ambitious ardor that the old rector and
Aunt Delia feared for his health; but
they need not have been anxious, for
wholesome food, regular habits, and,
above all, a life upon earth instead of
down under-ground was building up
the boy&#8217;s health, and bringing a sparkle
to his eyes and color to his pale cheeks
that sometimes reminded them of his
father long ago, in his happy boyhood.
The first Philip had been a merry,
frolicsome boy, whose pranks were the
torment and delight of the household;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
but the little son who had never known
him was so quiet that had it not been
for his music his presence would hardly
have been felt in the house. His quiet
was not quite to be called sadness, for
he was not unhappy; but the forced
repression of his early life and the
shock of his mother&#8217;s dreadful death
had left an ineffaceable impression
upon his character. Perhaps in time
he might have outgrown this tinge of
melancholy if he had been thrown into
the society of other boys, but the
entirely tranquil and eventless life he
lived at the rectory with the old
couple and his governess only served
to confirm it.</p>

<p>They were all such quiet people
that they never thought of its being
strange or unnatural that a child should
take his pleasure in the pursuits that
pleased them, and not in the boisterous
plays that boys delight in. He never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
seemed morbid, but was constantly
occupied with his books or music, and
always contented. His utter unselfishness
and sweet gentleness endeared
him to every one, and there was not a
servant on the place who did not adore
him. Old Peter would have laid down
his life for the boy whose father he had
loved so fondly; and long talks the
pair often had of the days when the old
man was chief counsellor in the &#8220;muddles,&#8221;
as he called them, that the boys&#8217;
high spirits used to lead them into.
&#8220;The boys&#8221; being Philip&#8217;s father and
uncle, the subject was of such inexhaustible
interest that whenever the
lad was missing Miss Acton always
came to Peter&#8217;s realm, the butler&#8217;s
room, to find him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, deary me!&#8221; the old man used
to say to himself sometimes, with a
troubled expression, when Philip had
been with him; &#8220;where-a-way is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
life of him? Them ones had life in
&#8217;em that &#8217;ud make &#8217;em pull the thatch
off a cottage if the notion took &#8217;em.
They wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;ave stopped for man
nor mortal, them lads wouldn&#8217;t, but
this little lad&#8217;s so still in his ways that
I&#8217;m thinking he&#8217;s gotten some hurt to
his insides that no one&#8217;s knowing. It&#8217;s
no so strange if the blow that killed the
mother did somewhat ill to the bairn, so
I&#8217;m fearin&#8217; this world won&#8217;t keep him
in it for long.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in spite of Peter&#8217;s gloomy forebodings
Philip grew strong and well,
and kept on the very even tenor of his
way till the summer came around again
and the inmates of the rectory were
expecting the return of Dr. Norton and
his family.</p>

<p>The rector always grew young again
when a visit from his nephew was impending,
and Aunt Delia, who had ever
looked forward with delight to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
pleasure of having her children with
her, now had a double happiness in
the anticipation of their pleasure and
surprise in finding her darling Philip
so improved in health, and every other
way, as he seemed to her loving eyes.
The joyful expectations of the old
couple were therefore unmixed with
any discomfort; but Philip and Miss
Acton were by no means rapturous in
regard to the coming visitors. The
latter, through her distressing timidity,
shrank from strangers at all times, and
the former, for reasons which he could
hardly have explained, dreaded seeing
his cousins again.</p>

<p>They arrived late one evening, and
in the unusual chatter and confusion
of tongues that prevailed till his bedtime
came, Philip had hardly time to
remember his misgivings, and even
Miss Acton found the ordeal not half
so dreadful as she had feared, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
one was so good-natured and genial.
Marion had not come with them,
having been allowed to accept an invitation
to spend the summer in
the Highlands with a cousin of her
mother&#8217;s. Philip&#8217;s admiration and dread
of his cousin were so mingled that he
was not quite certain whether her
absence was a relief or a disappointment,
but meeting his cousin Lillie
was an unmixed delight. Evidently
she had looked forward with pleasure
to seeing him again, for after her fond
greetings to her aunt and uncle she
immediately asked for him, and he was
not allowed to remain in the background.
Aunt Grace, too, embraced
him, and Dr. Norton, with loving affection,
took him to his arms, with a tenderness
in the tone with which he said,
&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; that made Philip feel
as if he would like to stay by his side
forever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>Rose was cordial too, although it is
quite probable that had Marion been
present and chosen to exhibit a distant
and haughty manner to her cousin,
Rose, who was her echo, would have
been chilling and disdainful too.</p>

<p>The twins had both grown, but Lillie
was still taller than her sister, and consequently
older-looking, which was a
grief to Rose, who longed to be grown
up. Philip made such a great advance
in her opinion by telling her she always
seemed to him much older than himself
that she felt amiably disposed to
be very gracious to him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norton&#8217;s pleasant manner even
overcame Miss Acton&#8217;s shyness, and
the visit that had been thought of with
dread turned out to be a very charming
one for all. All sorts of excursions, in
carriages and on foot, were undertaken
by the children in Miss Acton&#8217;s company,
and sometimes, when a very attractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
place was to be visited, Aunt
Delia and Mrs. Norton joined the
party, and added much to its pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something very important and
mysterious must have happened,&#8221; said
Dr. Norton one evening, &#8220;for Philip
and Aunt Delia have been running in
and out and whispering to each other
for the last half hour. What is the
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a little while, and don&#8217;t be inquisitive,&#8221;
said his aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can I help it when even
old Peter seems to be aiding and abetting
the mystery and I am not allowed
an inkling of it?&#8221; said Dr. Norton, with
a pretence of feeling very much injured.</p>

<p>It then became plain to every one
that there was a secret to be fathomed
and a plot of some kind going on, and
instant and earnest were the demands
of the twins to be intrusted at once
with the secret.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&#8220;Does Miss Acton know, Aunt
Delia?&#8221; asked Lillie, who had become
very fond of Philip&#8217;s governess.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not yet,&#8221; said Philip, answering
for his aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does mamma know?&#8221; asked Rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody knows yet,&#8221; said Aunt
Delia, as gleefully as if she was a child;
&#8220;but now you may all know. I didn&#8217;t
want to say anything till we were quite
sure, but now I think there will be no
failure. You know Ashden has been
closed to visitors ever since the family
went abroad ten years ago. Last
summer young Mr. Frederick Ashden
came back to look after some repairs
about the place, and now that his father
is dead and he is Lord Ashden, he has
decided to live there, and the house is
being cleaned and put in order. He is
in London now, but I have received a
note from him in answer to one I sent
him asking if we might go over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
house; for I knew that it would be such
a treat to you all. It used to be the
great show place of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, is he willing to let you go?&#8221;
asked the rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; he says he only regrets
that he may not return in time to
receive us. So if Thursday is a fair
day and you are all so disposed, we
will make an early start, see the castle
at our leisure, take lunch in the park,
and then come home in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is going to be generous
enough to give us luncheon in the
park?&#8221; said Rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall take it with us and have
a picnic,&#8221; said her aunt, with a triumphant
little nod of her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will you all get there?&#8221;
asked the rector, still disposed to think
there must be some flaw in arrangements
which had been made without
his assistance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, that is all provided for,&#8221; said
his wife, with another little nod. &#8220;Miss
Acton will drive Grace in the pony
phaeton, I am going in the carriage
with the children, and Peter is going to
bring the provisions in the little tax-cart.
If either of you gentlemen would
like to come, we will provide a way for
you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really your plans are very perfect
and your invitation very tempting,&#8221; said
Dr. Norton, &#8220;and I am not sure but
I&#8217;ll take a horse and ride over to Ashden
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do, do, papa!&#8221; exclaimed his
daughters, while Philip&#8217;s eager eyes
expressed the same wish.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it won&#8217;t be pleasant Thursday,
I know it won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Rose; &#8220;it will
be too good to be true, for us really
to see Ashden; something is sure
to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope not,&#8221; said Lillie, &#8220;for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
do so want to see the inside of that wonderful
place. Only think! There&#8217;s a
ghost-chamber, and a trap-door, and a
lake where a beautiful countess drowned
herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and they say that she walks
about every night,&#8221; said Rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t believe she was really
drowned,&#8221; said Philip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Phil,&#8221; said Lillie, laughing at
his sober face, &#8220;it happened a hundred
or a thousand years ago, or maybe a
million,&mdash;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know how
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, oh, won&#8217;t Marion envy us if
we do go!&#8221; said Rose, as if exciting
her sister&#8217;s envy was a large part of
the anticipated pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Lord Ashden live in that big
house all by himself?&#8221; asked Philip, as
he and his cousin Lillie went out to
look at the rabbits after supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it is so sad,&#8221; answered Lillie;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
&#8220;haven&#8217;t you heard?&#8221; And as Philip
shook his head, she went on, lowering
her voice: &#8220;Once Mr. Ashden was
married, you know, to the most be-a-u-tiful
young lady. Marion saw her once,
and she says she was like an angel.
Everybody loved her, and her husband,
they say, adored her. Well, when
they had been married only a year, she
was thrown from her horse and killed.
Wasn&#8217;t it dreadful? They say the poor
thing has been quite a changed man
from that day; and then his father,
Lord Ashden, died last year, and so now
he is quite alone in the world. He has
been travelling on the Continent since
last summer, but now he has come
back and opened the place, because he
knows it would have distressed his
father to have it neglected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Lord Ashden!&#8221; said Philip
gently. &#8220;I think I know a little how
sad and lonely he feels.&#8221; And Lillie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
knowing that her cousin was thinking
of his mother, gave his hand a sympathetic
squeeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Lillie,&#8221; said Philip, &#8220;I wish
everybody was as kind and gentle as
you are; and indeed everybody here has
been so good to me, sometimes I wonder
what I should have done when my
mother died if God had not sent me
here&mdash;and perhaps poor Lord Ashden
may find somebody to comfort him in
just the same way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children were silent after that,
and as they were going to bed, Lillie
whispered to her cousin: &#8220;I say, Philip,
you and I will pray that God will send
somebody to comfort Lord Ashden.&#8221;
And pray they did, and the next day
their prayer was answered in quite a
wonderful way, as we shall see.</p>

A Day at Ashden</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THURSDAY was as fair a day as
English eyes had ever looked upon.
&#8220;Queen&#8217;s own weather,&#8221; said Dr. Norton
at the early breakfast, which was taken
hours before the usual time in order to
lengthen out the long day of pleasure.</p>

<p>Even the rector was persuaded to
join the party which started in such
gay spirits, in the order proposed, except
that Rose gave her seat in the carriage
to her uncle and rode by her father&#8217;s
side on a shaggy little pony hired for
the occasion, which was to be ridden
by Lillie on the return trip.</p>

<p>Ashden Park was like a fairy domain
to the children, with its running streams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
spanned by fragile-looking bridges,
mimic waterfalls, dense labyrinths and
shady walks; but Aunt Delia advised
them to delay exploring the grounds
till they had seen the wonders of the
house.</p>

<p>The housekeeper met them at the
door, looking so very grand in her black
silk dress and lace cap with floating
strings that Philip was quite awe-struck,
and thought she must be a duchess at
the very least. But she was very gracious,
and, having been told by her
master of their expected visit, was prepared
to be extremely civil.</p>

<p>&#8220;His lordship left word, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; she
said to Mrs. Seldon, &#8220;that he was very
sorry he couldn&#8217;t &#8217;ave been &#8217;ome in
time to see you, but I was to show you
every attention, and after you &#8217;ad seen
the house, or before, just as it pleased
you, I was to beg you to take some
lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, thank you,&#8221; said the rector,
coming forward to shake hands with
Mrs. Hardy, who was one of his parishioners,
although she lived so far from
Lowdown. &#8220;You and Lord Ashden
are both very kind, but we have brought
a bite with us, and, if it is not a liberty,
propose to give the children a picnic
under some of those royal old oaks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir, his lordship will not be
half pleased, I&#8217;m afraid, and perhaps
you will change your mind after you
&#8217;ave looked through the &#8217;ouse. I&#8217;ll
show you the first floor myself, and
then if you won&#8217;t mind I&#8217;ll let one of
the men go over the rest with you, for
my rheumatism makes me so clumsy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They begged her not to take the
trouble to show them any part herself,
but she evidently took a delight in
escorting them through the lofty rooms
and halls, which they gratified her by
admiring immensely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>Going through the entire house was
more than the elder members of
the party cared to attempt, so Mrs.
Norton, Miss Acton, and the children
went upstairs, enjoying the confusing
and involved galleries and passages that
led to suite after suite of rooms. Those
in the centre of the castle were furnished
with modern elegance and lightness,
but in the wings the rooms were dark,
and filled with ancient furniture of
gloomy grandeur.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the room in which his
blessed Majesty King James the First
slept when he was entertained, with
nobles and gentlemen, by the noble
ancestor of his present lordship,&#8221; said
the servant who accompanied them, precisely
as if he were reciting a lesson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did a king really sleep in that great,
high, black bed?&#8221; said Rose, who was
deeply impressed with the grandeur of
the place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>&#8220;I suppose he did, as the man says
so,&#8221; said her mother, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t half care so much for the
bed the king slept in as for the room
where the ghost lives,&#8221; said Lillie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghosts don&#8217;t live,&#8221; said Miss Acton,
laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she do, miss!&#8221; said the
man, thinking she was throwing a
doubt over one of the attractions of the
place. &#8220;She stops in the tower-room
just up them stairs at the end of this
gallery, and if the ladies are not too
tired there&#8217;s a beautiful outlook from
the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>And there was a superb view from
the upper window of the tower, that
well paid them for the labor of mounting
the high stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;This ghost shows good taste in the
selection of a room,&#8221; said Mrs. Norton,
panting and out of breath as she came
behind the others to look from the window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
&#8220;that is, if ghostly persons don&#8217;t
mind stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say,&#8221; began the servant, assuming
the recitative tone and manner, &#8220;that
&#8217;er &#8217;eart was broken along of &#8217;er great
attachment to Another, but &#8217;er brother
compelled &#8217;er to marry a juke&#8217;s son who
treated &#8217;er ill on account of &#8217;er love for
Another. So she took &#8217;er vengeance on
&#8217;im by giving &#8217;im chopped &#8217;orse &#8217;air
hin &#8217;is provisions, which consumed &#8217;im
in great agony. As soon as &#8217;er husband
was killed, she wrote to Another
and learned that &#8217;is love was &#8217;ers no
longer, for &#8217;is marriage with a rival &#8217;ad
just taken place; whereupon the unfortunate
lady was seized with deep
repentance, and, leaving the rooms
she &#8217;ad formerly occupied, she secluded
herself in this lofty tower
chamber, refusing to eat or drink, till
one day the maid, knocking for admittance
and receiving no answer, &#8217;ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the door broke down, and found &#8217;er
lady a raving lunatic, which she flew
past &#8217;er down the stairs, and, running
out the door, drowned &#8217;erself in the
lake by the park gate, and &#8217;er uneasy
spirit is said to &#8217;aunt the precincts
ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>This breathless narrative was received
with much amusement by the
ladies; but the children were quite
awe-stricken at being in the haunts of
a ghost with a regular stopping-place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose there were any
real ghosts,&#8221; said Philip doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither did I,&#8221; said Aunt Grace,
laughing, &#8220;and I cannot say that I quite
believe in them yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The servant, whose faith in his ghost
was implicit, here pointed out to them
in the most respectful manner a fracture
in the door which was made when
it was &#8220;broke down,&#8221; evidently thinking
that was proof enough to convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the most sceptical. So, out of civility,
his audience forbore to appear to question
the evidence of their own eyes,
and followed their cicerone through
the other rooms, each of which, in the
old part of the castle, had its story of
family or historical interest. In the
chamber of an ancestress who had
been maid of honor to the queen of one
of the Georges stood a harp, swathed in
its ghostly white-linen cover.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; whispered Philip,
whose eye was caught by the uncovered
pedals.</p>

<p>&#8220;A harp, to be sure,&#8221; answered Rose,
with a superior air.</p>

<p>&#8220;A harp!&#8221; repeated Philip, with his
eyes shining. &#8220;Oh, if I could only see
it with the cover off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t do you any good if you
did,&#8221; said Rose unsympathizingly; &#8220;it
would be all unstrung and out of
tune.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8220;But I would be so glad just to look
at it,&#8221; said Philip, still lingering by the
muffled instrument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really so much want to see
a harp?&#8221; said Lillie, coming over from
an inlaid cabinet where the beautiful
maid of honor kept her trinkets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so very much,&#8221; said Philip, in
the earnest way he had sometimes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am not afraid to ask the
servant to take off the case,&#8221; said Lillie,
skipping up to the man and making her
request, with which he complied without
hesitation, slipping off the Holland
cover and revealing to Philip&#8217;s eager
eyes the old-fashioned, long-silent instrument.
Over it hung a copy of a
picture they had seen in the picture
gallery on the floor below. It was a
portrait of the owner of the harp; a
pretty figure in a fanciful shepherdess
costume, with a preternaturally white
lamb clasped in her lovely fair arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and a simpering complacency on her
pretty pink and white face that disposed
the gazer to doubt the possibility of her
ever having awakened the true soul of
music; but none of the party were
treasonable enough to contradict the
flunkey, who remarked, as he noticed
Mrs. Norton&#8217;s study of the portrait:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lady Blanche was said to &#8217;ave
played &#8217;er &#8217;arp like a hangel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would give anything to hear it
played,&#8221; said Philip, half to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a new &#8217;arp in the music-room,&#8221;
said the servant civilly, &#8220;if the
ladies would like to play for the young
gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Philip,&#8221; said Mrs. Norton,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t play oftener than once in six
months nowadays, but when we go
down I will try to gratify you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip was happy then, and felt as if
he could hardly wait till they reached
the music-room; but at last the tour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the house was completed, and the
servant led the way to the chapel-like
apartment in the western wing, and
there his aunt tried her skill in tuning
the more modern-looking instrument
that had belonged to the late Lady
Ashden. Her performance, after she
had put the harp in moderately good
tune, was not of a high order, but it
delighted Philip, who listened in ecstasy
as she struck the chords, a little uncertainly
it is true, but still with a sweetness
that thrilled the sensitive child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you could play on
it?&#8221; asked Rose of her cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Philip, shaking his head
sadly. &#8220;I could not play on it, but I
wish I could listen to it always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would soon tire of my miserable
playing, child,&#8221; said his aunt;
&#8220;but when you come to see us you
shall go to the concerts and hear some
music that is worth listening to.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>While Philip was shyly wondering
whether even the pleasure of listening
to the best of music would compensate
for the trial of seeing strangers, his
uncle came in to say that Aunt Delia
had prepared their lunch, and was
waiting for them in one of the little
rustic summer-houses that studded the
park.</p>

<p>The lunch was a marvel of daintiness,
for Mrs. Hardy had insisted upon
sending out the creams which had been
frozen in preparation for the repast they
were expected to take within doors, and
a splendid display of pines and other
fruit from the hot-houses. The whole
party were in the best of spirits, and
sufficiently hungry to do ample justice
to Aunt Delia&#8217;s good things.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as they were finishing,
Mrs. Norton announced that she had
lost her handkerchief and notebook. &#8220;I
must have left them in the maid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
honor&#8217;s room,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;or else
in the music-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I go and look for them?&#8221; said
Philip, springing up.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are quite sure you have
eaten all the cream you want,&#8221; said
his aunt. &#8220;But don&#8217;t try to find your
way; get that servant with the cockney
accent to show you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Off ran Philip, glad to be of service;
and the party, to give old Peter an
opportunity to lunch, adjourned to an
arbor in view, which was near enough
to a little natural lake for the children
to run to the margin with crumbs for
the stately swans that were sailing
about. The rector and Dr. Norton sat
talking rather sadly of the days when
old Lord Ashden was living; then they
spoke of his son, and of the sad ending
of his short and happy married life, and
in the midst of their reminiscences they
were surprised by the sudden appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the one they had been speaking
of&mdash;Lord Ashden himself. He had
returned a day before he expected, and
had come out to look for them. His
greeting to his old teacher and fellow-pupil
was warm and cordial, and after
paying his respects to the ladies he
joined them in recalling incidents and
exploits of his boyish days.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have taken poor Philip&#8217;s
child, I hear. It was brave and kind
of you to acknowledge him,&#8221; said he,
looking affectionately at the rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a kindness we should have
shown before,&#8221; said Dr. Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the boy? Does he inherit
his father&#8217;s genius and beauty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Aunt Delia, turning her
sweet, benevolent face upon the
speaker, &#8220;our little Philip seems to
have taken every pleasant trait of his
father&#8217;s, and a sweeter child I never
saw.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>&#8220;I must see Philip&#8217;s boy,&#8221; said Lord
Ashden, with a sigh of retrospection.
&#8220;Poor Philip! He literally threw
away his life; and such a life&mdash;so full
of hope and promise. I hope this boy&#8217;s
life may be a happier one than his
father&#8217;s was.&#8221; And he strode off
toward the house, where they told him
Philip would be found, impelled by a
feeling of real interest, the first he
had experienced in many sad and
weary months.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XII<br />

The Renewal of an Acquaintance</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">FOLLOWING Mrs. Seldon&#8217;s directions,
Lord Ashden climbed the
narrow stairs which led to the haunted
chamber. And as he approached the
room he was surprised to hear a faint
tinkling sound as of some one running
his fingers over the keys of an old
piano. Lord Ashden was puzzled,
and approaching more softly he gently
pushed open the door of the room and
looked within. It was a pretty picture
upon which his eyes rested, and one
which he long remembered. A fair,
slender lad with a pale, expressive face,
which reminded the silent on-looker of
the well-known portrait of Milton at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
age of twelve, was standing beside
the old harp which had belonged to the
poor, foolish maid of honor. He was
touching the dusty strings with the
greatest care and reverence, and a
smile of perfect delight played about
his sensitive, mobile mouth. But Lord
Ashden did not remain long unobserved,
for a shaggy little dog which
had been lying quietly at the boy&#8217;s feet
raised his head, and, perceiving the
stranger, began to bark fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down, Dash!&#8221; said Lord Ashden,
advancing into the room and holding
out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I live, my old friend Philip and
his dog Dash! How stupid I was not to
know that those eyes could belong only
to Philip Norton&#8217;s boy!&#8221; And Philip
remembered in a flash the happy day,
now more than a year since, which he
and Dash had spent on the lake with
the tall stranger whose name was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
&#8220;Frederick.&#8221; He quite forgot his awe
of Lord Ashden in explaining why he
had not returned for the promised row
on the lake, and he found himself talking
easily, and with no sense of reserve,
to this tall stranger whom he already
looked up to with boyish love and
almost reverence.</p>

<p>&#8220;So your mother is dead,&#8221; said Lord
Ashden kindly. &#8220;Poor little chap, I
think I know somewhat how it feels
to always carry an aching heart. You
must tell me all about her some day.
I have always wanted to know more
about Philip Norton&#8217;s wife; but let me
tell you, my boy, that you have reason
to be proud of your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know my father so very
well?&#8221; asked Philip timidly, hoping to
hear something about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said Lord Ashden.
&#8220;Has no one told you that we were
chums at college?&mdash;and afterward we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
travelled together for over a year. Your
father was an artist, you know, and I
had a painting fever myself in those
days, and used to perch by poor Philip&#8217;s
side day after day, copying the same
picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And are you an artist, too?&#8221; said
Philip, with a kind of reverent surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Phil,&#8221; said his lordship, with a
little laugh which turned into a sigh,
&#8220;neither that nor anything else that I
hoped to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure,&#8221; whispered Philip, &#8220;that
you are everything that is good, and I am
so glad you were fond of my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one could resist him,&#8221; said
Lord Ashden, looking kindly at the
boy. &#8220;I never saw any one make
friends as he did. Poor fellow! What
a bright future every one prophesied
for him, and how dreadful the tragic
ending of such a life of promise!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>Lord Ashden forgot, in his memories
of a past time, that he was speaking to
the son of the man whose fate he was
mourning, and for a little while he
seemed lost in reverie. Philip felt
flushed and uncomfortable, and had a
miserable feeling that he was in some
way to blame for his father&#8217;s fate. But
no such thought was in Lord Ashden&#8217;s
mind. After a few moments of silence
he seemed to wake to the fear that he
had been neglecting his young companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Phil!&#8221; he said, laying his hand
caressingly upon his shoulder! &#8220;you
can never know how worthy your father
was of love, or how he would have
loved you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, would he have loved me?&#8221;
exclaimed Philip eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would he?&#8221; said Lord Ashden in
surprise; &#8220;of course he would; what
doubt could there be?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>&#8220;I thought&mdash;I was afraid&mdash;I mean&mdash;I
didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Philip, hesitating
and feeling that he was on dangerous
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you think and fear, and
what didn&#8217;t you know?&#8221; said his friend,
smiling.</p>

<p>Philip&#8217;s embarrassment continued, but
he saw a look of expectancy in the
eyes turned to his which made him
feel that an answer was necessary.
He had never been forbidden to mention
his mother, but he felt instinctively
that his relatives did not expect
to hear her alluded to. Now he felt
that he could not explain his feelings
without speaking of her, and hence his
confusion; but there was no escape now,
so he honestly uttered his thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he would have disliked
me on account of my mother,&#8221; said he,
hanging his head to conceal his flushed
face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>&#8220;Dislike you on account of your
mother?&#8221; repeated the other in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Philip, still keeping his
face out of sight. &#8220;She was not like
him, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see how that should make
any difference,&#8221; said Lord Ashden
gravely. &#8220;Has any one said anything
to you against your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of my cousins said once that
she brought disgrace upon the family,&#8221;
murmured Philip. He might have
added that Marion also called her a
low, common woman, but he could
not have told that.</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame!&#8221; exclaimed Lord Ashden.
&#8220;Now listen, Philip, to what I
have to say of your mother. I never
saw her, you know, because&mdash;well, I
never did see her, but I understand
that she was not only beautiful, but
also good, true, and noble. A mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
that any boy might be very fond and
proud of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she was all that and more,&#8221;
cried Philip, his eyes full of tears of
sorrow and of pride to hear his mother
so praised; and then suddenly the sorrow
conquered all else and he began
to sob. Lord Ashden was in dismay,
but Philip soon looked up, smiling
through his tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must excuse me,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but, kind as everybody is to me, I do
miss my mother terribly. Oh, terribly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Ashden&#8217;s face had softened, and
he was looking through the window far
away across the distant hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; he said bitterly.
&#8220;No one can fill her place, no one.&#8221;
His face had grown suddenly wan and
almost haggard, and Philip remembered
in an instant the fair young wife
of whom Lillie had said that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
as beautiful as an angel, and that she
had only lived a year after their marriage.
He stole up to Lord Ashden
and slipped his small hand into his; the
other turned and looked down upon
him with a swift change of expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, my little man; I think we
understand each other, do we not?
And see here, let us make a compact,
with Dash as a witness, that from this
day forward you and I shall be <i>friends</i>,
eh?&mdash;what do you say, my boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord Ashden!&#8221; cried Philip
delightedly; &#8220;do you really mean it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my hand on it,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Did I hurt you? I&#8217;m not used to such
a scrap of a hand, you see. Come now,
we will go down and see if we can persuade
your aunt and uncle to let you
come over to Ashden again, day after
to-morrow. I want your opinion on a
violin I am thinking of buying, and then
perhaps I may let you try it yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Did you ever handle a bow? But see
here: if you are going to look like a
transfigured seraph every time I speak
of music, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t let you hear a note
until you have learned to row me about
on the lake. But now if we don&#8217;t go
downstairs and join the rest of the party,
they will think that the ghost of the
beautiful countess has made away with
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Seldon looked up in surprise as
she saw Lord Ashden and Philip advancing
toward her, hand in hand,
across the lawn, Dash following closely
at their heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only see, my dear,&#8221; she said to her
husband, &#8220;Frederick is actually smiling.
I really believe that dear child
could make the Sphinx love him; and
he grows so like his father! Frederick
must see it, and perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;little
Philip may help to fill the vacant
place in that big, lonely heart.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, Philip,&#8221; she said as they came
nearer, &#8220;so you and Lord Ashden are
friends already?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we find that we have met before,&#8221;
said Lord Ashden, smiling, &#8220;and
we have come especially to ask you,
please, to lend me your Philip now and
then for a day at Ashden. It is insufferably
dull and lonely here for me,
you know, Aunt Delia, but I believe if
I had Philip and Dash to help me it
would not be so difficult to kill time at
Ashden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall have my boy as often as
you wish, on one condition,&#8221; said Aunt
Delia, beaming on the pair through
her spectacles, &#8220;and that is that you
promise to come over to Lowdown each
time to fetch him, and that when you
bring him back you will stay for supper
at the rectory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; said Lord Ashden with
a handshake, the heartiness of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
made the old lady wince; &#8220;but now,
Philip, let us go and find the little girls
and take them for a row on the lake.
We must not forget the ladies, you
know.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XIII<br />

Lord Ashden&#8217;s Plan</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THAT was the first of many happy
days which Philip was to spend
at Ashden. Lord Ashden would
drive over to Lowdown two or three
times a week and carry him off for the
day, appearing to find real pleasure in
the boy&#8217;s society; and Aunt Delia was
overjoyed to notice that the sad fits of
despondency to which he had been subject
since the death of his young wife
seemed to have grown less frequent
since he had made a companion of
Philip. The boy seemed to fit perfectly
into his moods, and very soon
learned to understand when his companion
wished to be diverted, or when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
he cared only to sit quietly in the boat,
or under a tree, with a book, which at
such times Philip noticed he only pretended
to be reading, while his thoughts
were far away.</p>

<p>The boy knew then that he was thinking
of her, and his loving heart longed
to comfort his friend. And, indeed,
his affection and sympathy did comfort
Lord Ashden, love being a wonderful
balsam for wounded hearts. Sometimes
the sad and lonely man would
talk to Philip of his young wife, of her
radiant beauty, which was but the outward
expression of her singularly sweet
and noble nature, of her winning grace
of manner and the thousand varying
moods which made her society a continual
delight to her husband; and
then one day he spoke to Philip of that
awful day when he had raised her in
his arms from the roadside, so white
and still, and when he had prayed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he might die too. It is a tragic sight to
see a strong man weep as Lord Ashden
did that afternoon, and Philip held
him close in his loving arms, as his
mother had been used to do with him
when he was struggling with some
childish grief.</p>

<p>From that day the two friends seemed
to be drawn more closely together;
Lord Ashden talked often to Philip of
his friendship with the latter&#8217;s father,
and Philip told him some things his
mother had told him of the years after
his marriage, when he had withdrawn
so completely from his old associates
and friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old Phil!&#8221; Lord Ashden would
exclaim. &#8220;I shall never forgive myself
for not having insisted upon seeing him;
and yet it would doubtless have caused
him real humiliation and pain to have
been sought out by his old friends, in such
altered conditions. Well, at least I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
try to make up for it all by doing what
I can for little Philip, eh, my lad? And
now,&#8221; he would say, jumping up suddenly,
&#8220;let us go indoors for a little
music. What shall it be this afternoon,
your favorite Mendelssohn or some
more Schubert?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the way in which, after a
morning spent out-of-doors, their afternoons
were pretty sure to be passed.
Lord Ashden had had a fine musical
education, and he possessed the keen
appreciation of genius which is itself a
kind of genius; he soon discovered that
Philip possessed a most unusual aptitude
for the violin, and he set himself to the
task of teaching him to play, at first for
the diversion which it afforded himself,
and then for the real delight which he
felt in the boy&#8217;s progress.</p>

<p>One afternoon, late in the summer,
when he had been accompanying his
pupil on the piano through a very difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
concerto, he stopped suddenly and,
wheeling about on the piano-stool, laid
his hands on Philip&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, my boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;<i>I</i>
can&#8217;t teach you any more; an interpretation
like that is not learned, but
gained by direct intuition; you have
lots of work to do yet, of course, and
your bowing is not perfect by any
means; but&mdash;well, you just keep on
practising while I think out a scheme
of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few days after this Lord Ashden
rode over to Lowdown and requested
an interview with the rector and Aunt
Delia in the former&#8217;s study.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one under thirteen years of age
admitted,&#8221; he said, laughing as the
children gathered around him in the
hall as usual. The three friends were
closeted for more than an hour, and
when they came out Aunt Delia&#8217;s eyes
were red as though she had been weeping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
yet she looked very happy too;
and at supper she exchanged meaning
glances with her husband when the
children inquired why Lord Ashden had
not remained with them as usual.</p>

<p>When bedtime came Philip was told
to remain in the library after the other
children had gone upstairs, and then
the secret of the afternoon&#8217;s conference
was explained. Lord Ashden had
ridden over from Ashden to ask permission
to take Philip abroad for a
musical education such as he believed
could be secured only on the Continent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he had said, &#8220;I know it
is asking a great deal, for Philip has
grown very dear to you both; but to
me, bereft as I have been of every one
I once loved, this dear child has become
almost indispensable. For the first
time since my poor wife died I begin to
feel that the future holds something in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
for which to strive, and to which I can
look forward without despair. Only
give me Philip, dear friends, and I
promise it shall be for the boy&#8217;s best
good; for I love him already as my own
son, as I loved his father in the old
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We would be selfish indeed,&#8221; said
Aunt Delia, with streaming eyes, &#8220;were
we to refuse such a generous offer, but
Philip himself must decide; although of
course I know what his answer will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good rector too, although he
could not trust himself to think of how
silent and lonely the old house would
be without his little nephew, was yet
rejoiced that the boy should have such
a rare opportunity of cultivating his
musical ability.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always said that his playing
was wonderful,&#8221; he exclaimed proudly;
&#8220;and I believe our boy will some day
make a name for himself and for us all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>When the purport of this interview
was explained to Philip he seemed
dazed by the prospect of such unlooked-for
good fortune, and for a
moment he said nothing, standing quite
still with clasped hands, and his expressive
face quivering with delight; but
suddenly he discovered Aunt Delia
furtively wiping her spectacles, and the
self-reproachful tears sprang at once to
his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Delia! Uncle Seldon!
forgive me!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;How could I
be so selfish as to think of leaving my
dearest and best friends? Nothing I
can do could ever repay you for your
kindness, and certainly I will never,
never leave you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling boy!&#8221; said Aunt Delia,
drawing him down beside her on the
sofa, while the good old clergyman
blew his nose very hard and looked
out of the window, &#8220;such sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
do you credit, and are worthy of our
dear, dead Philip&#8217;s son; but your uncle
and I could not think of accepting such
a sacrifice. One disappointed career in
a family is quite enough, dear boy, and
if your father had to give up his art,
you at least shall have as good a chance
with your music as we can give you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; added the rector hastily,
&#8220;don&#8217;t think of us, Philip lad; we shall
get on fairly well, I fancy; and then,
you know, in after years your aunt and
I will share in your triumphs. How
proud we shall be of our nephew, the
great violinist, Signor Philip Norton!
Sounds well, doesn&#8217;t it? There won&#8217;t
be a prouder woman in England than
your Aunt Delia then, and as for your
old uncle, the rectory will be hardly
large enough to contain him, if he is
still alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, almost in spite of his hesitation,
Philip found himself gently pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
forward into a career which seemed to
be too beautiful to be real; indeed, he
half expected to awake some morning
and find that the whole plan had been
only a lovely dream.</p>

<p>But the preparations for his journey
went steadily on, and each morning
Philip would look at the calendar and
say:</p>

<p>&#8220;In a month we start&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;in a week&#8221;&mdash;and
then&mdash;&#8220;to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not go to Ashden very much
during those last days, for he wanted
to spend every moment with the dear
friends at the rectory; nor did he see
much of Lord Ashden, who had
many preparations to make for what
might be a long absence, and who,
moreover, with great delicacy, forbore
to intrude upon these last days, which
he knew were sad ones for the dear old
clergyman and his wife.</p>

<p>The bustle and stir incident upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
preparation for such a long journey
were an immense relief to Aunt Delia,
and she gave herself not a moment to
think of what the house would be like
when her darling boy should have
gone. She had Philip&#8217;s boxes all
packed and strapped a full week before
he was to start, and then she thought
of so many things which she had forgotten
to put in that she unpacked
them all again; and she repeated this
operation several times before she was
quite satisfied. For some unaccountable
reason, as the travellers were
going directly south, the dear old lady
was convinced that Philip would need
the most extraordinary amount of extra
clothing, and she smuggled into his
boxes enough flannel and woollen garments
to have equipped an expedition
to the polar regions. She was also
convinced that both Philip and Lord
Ashden would need at least a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of knitted mufflers apiece, and after a
busy day spent in running up and down
stairs and packing and unpacking
boxes, she would sit up half the night
knitting away, as though her life depended
upon it, on these same mufflers,
while her loving thoughts and hopes
for Philip&#8217;s future travelled faster even
than the flying needles.</p>

<p>But there was another member of
the household who was even more excited
over the preparations for departure
than Aunt Delia herself. This was
Dash, who from the first moment that
the journey was suggested seemed to understand
that some momentous change
was near at hand. When Philip&#8217;s boxes
were brought down from the garret, he
went sniffing anxiously about them, and
when Aunt Delia laid one of the boy&#8217;s
familiar garments in one of them, the
little dog sat down beside it, and throwing
back his head began to howl so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
piteously that Philip, who was practising
in the next room, came running in
to see if he were ill or in pain. After
that Dash seemed fully to comprehend
that his master was going on a journey,
and from having always followed him
about very faithfully he became his
veritable shadow. If Philip but crossed
the room Dash was at his heels, and at
night he deliberately forsook the box
in a corner of the school-room, in which
he had formerly slept very contentedly,
and would curl himself up on the foot
of Philip&#8217;s bed, from which neither
threats nor entreaties could drive him
away. Philip, indeed, begged that he
might be allowed to remain, for it had
been decided that Dash must be left at
Lowdown, and his little master&#8217;s heart
felt strangely sad and heavy at the
thought of parting from his faithful
friend.</p>

<p>One night Aunt Delia, coming softly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
into his room with a light, to be sure
that her boy was warmly covered, was
surprised to hear a sound of suppressed
sobbing issuing from beneath the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Philip,&#8221; she said, coming
nearer, &#8220;what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Delia, I do feel so sad at
the thought of leaving Dash, and he
seems to understand; I believe he
really thinks that I am very mean and
heartless to go away and leave him
behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dash himself, who was lying quietly
in Philip&#8217;s arms, now and then licking
the boy&#8217;s hand, looked up so reproachfully
at Aunt Delia as she leaned over
the bed that her kind heart was really
touched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good doggie,&#8221; she said kindly, patting
his shaggy head, &#8220;don&#8217;t you suppose
<i>I</i> mind being left behind too?
And don&#8217;t you think that I shall miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
our Philip when he is gone? You and
I must learn to be good friends, and
then we can comfort each other, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Dash, who really seemed to understand
everything that was said to
him, showed his appreciation of Mrs.
Seldon&#8217;s sympathy by leaving Philip
to come and poke his little black nose
affectionately into her face, and when
she gave a little scream of surprise and
began to wipe her cheek where the
wet nose had touched it, Philip was so
much amused that he laughed merrily;
and when Aunt Delia came into the
room again half an hour later, he was
sound asleep, with Dash curled up in a
little yellow ball beside him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XIV<br />

Off for Italy</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AND then at last the day came when
Philip was to start on his travels,
and everybody was trying so hard to
bear up and be cheerful that there
was quite an air of false gayety about
the household. Only one member of
the family seemed to be indifferent
about Philip&#8217;s departure, and this was
his cousin Marion, who had returned
the week before from her visit to Scotland,
where she had been flattered and
made so much of for her beauty and
accomplishments that her silly head
was quite turned. She was deeply
chagrined on her return to find that
Philip, instead of herself, was the central<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
figure in the family circle. She
had the greatest admiration for Lord
Ashden, and felt a respect for his rank
and title which amounted almost to
veneration. She was secretly quite
enraged that he should have selected
this boy, whose parentage on one side
was, to say the least, decidedly obscure,
and should have paid him so much
attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what Lord Ashden can
be thinking of,&#8221; she said, with flashing
eyes, to her younger sisters, who were
disposed, on her first return home, to
regard her with a kind of admiring awe.
&#8220;I suppose Philip asked Lord Ashden to
take him abroad with him, and of course
he is far too good-natured to refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, indeed,&#8221; the truthful Rose
was obliged to reply. &#8220;He did not,
indeed, Marion; for when Aunt Delia
told him of Lord Ashden&#8217;s invitation,
he was as much surprised as we were.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>&#8220;Fiddlesticks!&#8221; said Marion, tossing
her head; &#8220;you all seem to think that
Philip is as innocent as a lamb. He
may be as stupid as one, that I will
grant you,&#8221; and Marion laughed unpleasantly
at her own witticism. Rose
echoed the laugh, although rather faintly,
and she was glad that Lillie had been
called from the room, and so had not
heard Marion&#8217;s ill-natured remark.</p>

<p>As for Philip, his thoughts were too
full of other things to notice his cousin
Marion&#8217;s behavior very much. He had
always been a sincere admirer of her
beauty and cleverness, but the first
evening of her return he decided that,
after all, Lillie was far the sweeter and
more lovable of the two girls; and even
Rose, he thought, who was rather plain
and freckled, had a much more amiable
expression than her handsome elder
sister.</p>

<p>When the time came to say good-by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and Philip was going about with
rather a sad smile, shaking hands and
embracing the dear friends who had
made his stay at the rectory such a
happy one, he noticed that Marion
seemed to hold back, and he tried not
to care, although he flushed painfully
as he went toward her, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, Marion,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I am so
sorry that I am leaving just as you have
come back to Lowdown.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply, and held out a
limp, reluctant hand. &#8220;Good-by,&#8221; she
said coldly at last, as he waited hesitatingly
for a word.</p>

<p>Philip gave her a swift glance, and
then, overcoming his shyness, he said
impulsively:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Marion, is that all you can say&mdash;not&mdash;not
just one word to wish me
success with my music?&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice trembled a little, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
cousin could not resist the pleading in
his eyes. She dropped her own, saying
rather more graciously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, oh, yes, of course I wish you
good luck. I am very glad that you
are to have such a fine chance to see
something of the world, and I hope&mdash;that
is&mdash;I am sure that you will try to
be a credit to the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the carriage from Ashden
arrived, bringing Lord Ashden, who
had been detained at the last moment,
so that there was just time for Philip
to jump in beside him, and the horses
started off on a run to the railroad
station.</p>

<p>Philip stood up on the seat of the
carriage, waving his cap; he kept his
eyes fastened upon Aunt Delia, who
was keeping her promise not to cry, by
laughing hysterically at the frantic efforts
of poor Dash to escape from her
arms and follow his young master. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
then a turn in the road hid the carriage
and the little swaying figure from the
sight of the group on the rectory steps,
and Mr. Seldon put his arm gently
around his wife, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;How I wish that our Philip could
see his boy to-day! Do you notice how
like his father the dear boy grows?&#8221;</p>

<p>As for Philip, he was very grave and
silent during the journey to London,
but the first glimpse of the great city
aroused all his enthusiasm, and he
chattered and laughed and asked questions
as they were being driven to the
hotel, while Lord Ashden leaned back
in the cab, pleased and diverted by
the boy&#8217;s exclamations of interest and
pleasure. As for Philip himself, it was
pleasure enough to be travelling alone
with a man like Lord Ashden, for
whom, from the first moment of meeting
him on that memorable day in the
woods, he had cherished a sort of rapturous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
admiration, which was something
very different from his cousin Marion&#8217;s
silly veneration for rank. Indeed, he
was still far too innocent of the world&#8217;s
ways to be conscious of the value placed
on high position; and Lord Ashden,
sick of the insincerity and shallowness
of the people whom he met in society,
found a large measure of the happiness
which he had thought to have lost forever,
in the society of this true-hearted
boy.</p>

<p>They spent only one night in London,
starting the next day for the Continent.
It had been their intention to go on at
once to Italy, but Lord Ashden was
detained in Paris by important business
for more than a month, and this was a
period of constant wonder and delight
to Philip.</p>

<p>Marwin, Lord Ashden&#8217;s confidential
servant, was an experienced traveller,
and in his care Philip visited the places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
that he and Miss Acton had tried to see
in imagination in the long, quiet evenings
at Lowdown, when Aunt Delia
had talked to them of her own extensive
travels throughout Europe. Philip
recognized several of the places which
he now visited, from Mrs. Seldon&#8217;s
graphic description of them. Marvin
was an intelligent guide, and his running
commentary upon what they saw
was listened to by his young charge
with flattering attention. Lord Ashden
was not able to go about very much,
and the sights of Paris were not novelties
to him; but every evening he drew
from Philip a description of his day&#8217;s
adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the very best day of all?&#8221;
he would say, as the boy&#8217;s bright, expressive
face appeared at his door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, sir, the very, very best of
all,&#8221; would be the answer he was always
sure of receiving. The certainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of finding ready sympathy made the boy
willing to speak freely of his thoughts
and emotions, and Lord Ashden, who
had the gift of drawing people out,
sometimes led him on, after hearing an
account of the places he had seen, to
talk of thoughts, hopes, and desires that
he had never spoken of to any one.</p>

<p>It was on a morning after one of these
conversations that Lord Ashden announced
his intention of taking Philip
himself to see some pictures. They
were not in a public gallery, but were
the choice private collection of a distinguished
patron of art, who occasionally
threw open his gallery to an appreciative
public. There was no one
present but themselves when they first
entered the room and walked about,
examining the pictures at leisure.
There was a curious mingling of ancient
and modern art, but to Philip&#8217;s
undistinguishing eye, all of them were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
beautiful, and he listened entranced
while his friend explained the subject of
one and another of his own favorites.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear boy!&#8221; he exclaimed
suddenly, after giving a most entertaining
account of the &#8220;Barmecides&#8217; Feast,&#8221;
which hung before them, &#8220;how vividly
all this talk about pictures reminds me
of your father!&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew quite well that this was a
subject of which his companion never
grew weary, and it was the subject, too,
which always drew this strangely assorted
pair more closely together. They
sat down on a bench in a quiet corner,
and many a visitor to the gallery that
morning lingered to admire the tall,
distinguished-looking Englishman who
was talking with such earnestness to
the beautiful, fair-haired boy, who with
eager, upturned face looked almost like
one of the young angels in a celebrated
picture which hung just above his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>This was but one of many happy
days of intimate companionship and
sight-seeing, and Philip, even with Italy
in prospect, turned his back upon the
gay French capital with a long sigh of
regret. When they reached Rome
they found that the famous teacher
whose advice Lord Ashden had come
so far to seek for Philip had left, a few
months before, to take charge of a large
conservatory at Milan. They decided
not to follow him at once, however, for
Lord Ashden was anxious that Philip
should see something of the Eternal
City before settling down to work and
study. He himself was guide this
time, and he took the boy to palaces
and picture galleries, to cathedrals and
studios and concerts, until Philip was
scarcely able to sleep at night, for
thinking of the wonder and the beauty
of it all; and then his wise and kind
guide planned that they should spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
a day or two at Naples, which they
passed drifting about on the beautiful
bay, and so when Philip was quite
rested again, they travelled on by easy
stages to Milan.</p>

<p>Signor Marini was such an exceedingly
busy man that it was several
days before he could make time to
have Philip brought to the conservatory.
The great teacher was very fond
of Lord Ashden, and would have gone
out of his way to have done him a
favor, but he was rather sceptical
about Philip&#8217;s playing; he had had several
rather unfortunate experiences with
child musicians, and was sceptical about
infant prodigies in general. Moreover,
he assured his friend that if the Angel
Gabriel should have come down from
heaven to take lessons from him just at
this time, he could not have complied
with his request.</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand,&#8221; he said in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
quick, Italian way, &#8220;I can no longer
teach any one&mdash;not the greatest violinist
living. I am too busy and too old&mdash;and
my conservatory, the management
of it, the routine, it is enough; but you
may bring your boy, ah, yes, I will find
for him the best teacher in Milan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, signor,&#8221; said Lord Ashden,
disappointed, &#8220;I had hoped that you
would take the boy yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite impossible!&#8221; said the teacher,
shaking his head, &#8220;but, as I said, bring
the boy, and we will see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately, Philip did not realize
the importance of the ordeal through
which he was to pass, when one morning
at breakfast Lord Ashden said
quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to bring your violin,
and come with me this morning to
play for an old friend of mine, who
may be able to give you some valuable
advice about your music.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>After breakfast, accordingly, they
drove for several miles through the
older portion of the city, and at last
the carriage drew up before a dingy
door in what had been an ancient palace.
They were ushered without delay to
the private office of the maestro, a
little, wiry, keen-eyed old man, in a
greasy smoking-jacket, and smelling
strongly of tobacco. He looked at
Philip sharply from under his shaggy
eyebrows, remarking with a kind of
grunt, in Italian:</p>

<p>&#8220;Handsome, like his father,&#8221; for
Signor Marini remembered the young
English artist who had been travelling
with Lord Ashden during his last
visit to Italy, and who had dabbled a
little in music, as he said himself,
&#8220;while he waited for the first coat of
paint to dry on his canvases.&#8221;</p>

<p>In fact, the old man was so full of
reminiscences that Lord Ashden was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
obliged at last to remind him of the
real object of the visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; grunted the music teacher
rather ungraciously. &#8220;The boy may
play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip, who had been examining
some rare and beautiful musical instruments
which were in the room,
opened his violin case at once and
stood, bow in hand, looking inquiringly
from Lord Ashden to Signor Marini,
with a simple desire to know their
pleasure and an utter absence of embarrassment
or nervousness which
rather surprised the Italian.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I play, sir?&#8221; asked the
boy, and the teacher named a rather
difficult <i>tude</i> which, fortunately for
Philip, he had been practising within
the week.</p>

<p>The maestro pretended at first not to
be listening very attentively; indeed, he
yawned once or twice and walked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the window, where he stood drumming
noiselessly upon the pane with his dirty
fingers; but, after a little, he began to
listen more attentively, and when the
first few wailing notes of the violin had
melted into the very passionate intensity
of the second measure of the composition,
he wheeled suddenly around, sat
down with his arms folded on the back
of a chair, and listened with unbroken
attention to the end.</p>

<p>When Philip had finished playing he
laid his violin down carefully on the
table and turned toward Lord Ashden
with an inquiring smile as though he
would have said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it all right, my friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Ashden did not reply, but he
looked at Signor Marini with an amused
smile. The whole expression of the
latter&#8217;s face had changed, and presently
he said to Philip:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>Philip went over to him at once, with
a pretty, respectful inclination of the
head, which seemed to please the old
man. He asked him a few short, rapid
questions about his practising, his instrument,
and his plans for the future.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have formed some rather bad
habits in your playing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They
can only be corrected by very hard
work.&#8221; He paused a moment with his
glittering eyes fixed upon the boy&#8217;s upturned
face. &#8220;Tell me, are you willing
to work hard, very hard? to practise
all day, and, if necessary, all night,
too? Are you willing to give up everything&mdash;pay
attention now to what I
am saying&mdash;to give up <i>everything</i> for
your art?&#8221; And, as Philip nodded
gravely, fixing his earnest eyes full
upon the old man&#8217;s face, the latter got
up from his chair, which he pushed
away from him with so much violence
that it fell over on the floor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I believe you;
when can you begin&mdash;at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, turning to Lord Ashden, he
held out his hand. The latter was
smiling in spite of himself, as he said,
trying to speak seriously:</p>

<p>&#8220;And what about the teacher for the
boy, of whom you spoke?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old music teacher smiled a little
grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will take
the boy myself, provided you will consent
to his living in my house, so that
he may give me all his time for the
practice he so much needs. No, no
thanks. Think it over, and when you
have decided send the boy to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it was arranged that Philip
was to be left behind in Milan for a
year while Lord Ashden went to Egypt
with some friends, but not before he
had assured himself that the boy would
be quite happy in the household of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Signor Marini, who, in spite of his
peculiarities, had a very kind and generous
nature, while his fat and rather
stupid wife was overflowing with good-nature.
They promised to do all in
their power to make Philip as happy
and comfortable as he could be under
such altered conditions, and they kept
their word; it must be confessed, however,
that the boy suffered a great deal
for the first month or two from that
most unbearable of all complaints,
homesickness; but after that he did not
have much time to think of his friends
in England, or indeed of anything else,
for he soon became completely absorbed
in conquering the difficulties of
exercises and studies.</p>

<p>Signor Marini was a stern taskmaster,
and it was a peculiarity of his that
he seldom praised or encouraged his
pupils; sometimes, however, when
Philip had conquered a difficult passage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
his teacher would give expression
to his satisfaction in a kind of grunt
which Philip soon grew to look for and
to value as the highest kind of praise.
Nor did his teacher make much reply
to Lord Ashden&#8217;s frequent letters of
inquiry concerning his pupil&#8217;s progress.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I told you that I did not
believe much in precocious children,&#8221;
he wrote once, &#8220;but Philip I believe is
something more than that. If I did
not believe that he had a future before
him, I should certainly not be spending
so much time upon his training.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this assurance Lord Ashden
was obliged to be content, and
although the year of separation from
Philip was harder for him than for
the boy, he waited patiently, believing
the life in Milan to be just what his
young charge needed.</p>

Drifting</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE days had passed swiftly by,
and Philip had been for more than
three years in the household of Signor
Marini at Milan. To be sure he had
been carried off by Lord Ashden for a
month or two at the end of the first
year&#8217;s work, and a glorious holiday it
had been. The two travelled together
through Switzerland, and Philip surprised
his companion by his powers of
endurance and his ability to undertake
the most difficult and often dangerous
feats of mountain-climbing without
nervousness or fatigue. The joy of
being united was equally great on both
sides, and despite the great difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in their ages, Lord Ashden found in
Philip the most congenial of companions,
while the boy looked up to his
friend with a glowing admiration and
affection which day by day increased
and strengthened.</p>

<p>It was a painful moment for both
when, the vacation over, Philip returned
to Milan for another twelve
months of work and study, while Lord
Ashden made a visit to England,
promising to return for Philip&#8217;s <i>dbut</i>
the following autumn, for Signor Marini
had pushed his private scholar with
might and main, and his enthusiastic
hopes for Philip&#8217;s future made the old
man quite young again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I live over again in your playing,
my boy,&#8221; he would say, and he himself
made all the arrangements for his
pupil&#8217;s first public appearance at La
Scala.</p>

<p>Philip himself was strangely unmoved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
by the prospect of playing
before the largest, and perhaps the
most critical, audience in all Europe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can but do my best,&#8221; he said
quietly with his flashing smile, and he
was far more excited over the promise
of Lord Ashden to come to Milan for
the occasion than at the thought of the
promised presence of royalty itself in
the audience.</p>

<p>The night came, and Signor Marini
was not disappointed in his pupil. The
effect upon the audience of his uncommon
beauty and youthfulness, and his
wonderful playing, were instantaneous
and lasting, and round upon round of
applause greeted each appearance and
exit.</p>

<p>Lord Ashden stood at the wings, pale
with excitement, and when Philip came
quietly towards him, saying simply:
&#8220;They seem to like my playing, do
they not?&#8221; he folded the boy in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
arms, saying in a voice trembling with
emotion:</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling boy, this is the proudest
and happiest moment of my life!
And now that the world recognizes
your talent, and you have won
your place in the topmost ranks, my
dear boy, we must give you a long
vacation,&#8221; he said later, when, the performance
being over, they were taking
supper in his lordship&#8217;s room at the
hotel.</p>

<p>Lord Ashden then unfolded a plan
of taking Philip with him on an extended
tour through Europe and the
East.</p>

<p>The boy was overcome with gratitude,
but quietly firm in his refusal to
accept the tempting invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But please,&#8221; he said, forcing himself
to speak calmly, &#8220;please do not
think me ungrateful for your kindness.
You came to me like an angel, and supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
me all these long years, and
gave me the opportunity to acquire my
beloved art. You have given me the
power to live by my own efforts, to be
happy in the only way that happiness
is possible to me. Even if I could do
it, you would not accept the repayment
of the money I have cost you; but if
you took it, the debt would be in no
way cancelled, for a thousand times the
sum would be far from paying for the
kindness that trusted and befriended
me, and made me what I am.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Lord Ashden,&#8221; he went on,
quite breaking through his usual shy
reserve, &#8220;I can never kneel to pray
without returning thanks for such a
friend as you; and I can never touch
my beloved violin without thinking of
you, and hoping that some day it may
be my turn to do some little thing for
you. Now, before the impression I
have had the good fortune to make has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
faded away, I must work for a place in
the world. Maestro Marini says teaching
is the surest support, but to-night
makes me hope that I may continue
upon the stage; and, if you approve, I
shall try for an engagement. But I
must go to England first&mdash;I owe it to
dear Aunt Delia. I suppose there is
no one else there who will care much,
but she writes to me so tenderly, and
every letter says: &#8216;Dear boy, come
home.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be as you please,&#8221; said Lord
Ashden, &#8220;and the travelling shall be
postponed till you are ready. But
don&#8217;t feel burdened with gratitude to
me&mdash;your success quite repays me. I
am sorry to start off on my travels
without you, but I expect to hear great
things of you when I come back. Unless
I am mistaken, the newspapers
will tell me something of your career
while I am away. You are not destined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to obscurity, my boy; such talent
as yours will make you famous, and I
dare to tell you so because I know that
nothing will make you conceited; if
anything, you are too humble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Praise from such a source was very
precious to Philip, and often afterward
he repeated the words again to himself
as an encouragement to the hope he
hardly dared to cherish, that some day
his father&#8217;s family might be just a
little, a very little, proud of him, and
that even Marion might perhaps be
no longer ashamed to own him for a
relative.</p>

<p>Philip&#8217;s engagement at La Scala
lasted for a week, and each night he
repeated his triumphs; the city rang
with the fame of the boy violinist, and
he was petted and flattered and fted to
a degree which might have completely
turned the head of an ordinary boy of
thirteen, but Philip remained quite un-spoiled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and was secretly glad when the
week neared its close.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that he should
return at once to England with Lord
Ashden, for he longed to see the dear
friends at Lowdown whom he had never
once forgotten in his long separation
from them. Nevertheless, when at last
the day arrived upon which they were
to leave Milan, Philip was sad at the
thought of parting from good Signor
Marini and his fellow-pupils at the
Conservatory. The famous teacher
had greatly prided himself upon being
always able to conceal his emotions;
he was indeed inclined to look with
disdain upon any display of feeling,
and to consider it quite out of place
for one in his position; yet when the
moment came for him to bid farewell
to his little pupil, his feelings quite
overcame him and he burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; he said, straining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Philip to his heart, &#8220;what shall I do
when you are gone? I have loved you
like a dear son, and you&mdash;you will
soon forget your poor old teacher, who
has been so often cross and severe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no, my dear, dear master!&#8221;
replied the boy, his own eyes swimming
with tears; &#8220;you have been always
the wisest of teachers and the
kindest and best of friends; indeed,
indeed, I will never forget you and good
Signora Marini.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will come again to Milan?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now Lord Ashden&#8217;s turn to
speak; he had not remained unmoved
during this touching scene, which exhibited
his old friend, the hard, rather
unfeeling music teacher in quite a new
light.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see to it,&#8221; he said kindly,
laying one hand on the shoulder of the
old man and the other on Philip&#8217;s fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
head, &#8220;that two such fast friends meet
again, and that before very long. The
distance between Milan and London
grows shorter every year, you know,
and I am not sure but I shall turn up
here again myself before long, and
perhaps I can persuade our young
friend to come too.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the sadness of their parting was
lessened for both teacher and pupil,
between whom there existed a very
true and real friendship and affection,
and as Philip turned away from the
dingy old house which had been his
home for three years, he waved his
cap to the sad little group on the doorstep,
shouting, &#8220;Addio, addio, my
friends, until next winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached Paris a friend of
Lord Ashden, who was just starting on
a cruise on his yacht, begged the travellers
to accompany him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our little violinist is looking decidedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
thin and pale,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
it will never do to send him back to
England until he has some color in his
cheeks. His friends will surely think
that he has been starved and ill-treated
in Italy; come off with me for a fortnight
and I promise you the time will
not be wasted.&#8221; And Lord Ashden,
when he came to look more critically,
at Philip remarked that it was as his
friend said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he said; &#8220;the dear
boy is pale and thin. What an idiot I
was not to have noticed it before! I
know you are impatient to see the dear
friends in England, Philip, but just this
once I must have my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Philip, although he was at first
keenly disappointed to delay for another
two weeks the joyous home-coming to
which he had looked forward for so
long, was yet forced to admit the wisdom
of Lord Ashden&#8217;s decision. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
he had not realized how thoroughly
tired he was until he went aboard the
yacht and his exhausted nerves and
muscles could thoroughly relax.</p>

<p>There were long delicious days when
the yacht drifted lazily through the
calm blue waters of the Mediterranean,
and life seemed only a hazy dream of
warm sunshine and opalescent sea and
sky. Philip would lie in a steamer-chair
under a green sun-umbrella, with
half-closed eyes, and sometimes with
an unopened book in his lap, thinking
over the days in Milan, or picturing the
delight of once again sitting in the
pleasant drawing-room at Lowdown,
with the rector, dear Aunt Delia,
Dr. Norton and his gentle wife, and
the little girls. Philip smiled as he
thought of how many questions he
should have to ask and to answer;
he wondered if he should find them all
much changed in the years since he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
had seen them. Lillie and Rose would
be much taller, he supposed, and
Marion quite a young lady&mdash;Lord
Ashden had told him that she was preparing
to make her <i>dbut</i> into London
society the following winter; and Dash&mdash;dear
old fellow! He had never
been quite the same, Aunt Delia wrote,
since Philip&#8217;s departure, and he had not
forgotten him&mdash;oh, no! For whenever
Philip&#8217;s name was mentioned he would
prick up his ears and give a little excited
bark. Philip loved to think of
how Dash would come running down
the path when he should hear his
master&#8217;s familiar whistle at the gate.
Oh, it was glorious to have learned
really to play the violin, and to feel
that he could without shame take his
place among the great musicians whom
only three years ago he had regarded
reverently as beings of another
sphere; but, after all, the boy thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
there was no joy in the world quite so
great as the joy of going home, and of
being united once again with the dear
friends who loved him, not because he
was talented or famous, but for himself.</p>

<p>Lord Ashden left Philip a great deal
to himself during these long, lazy days
on the yacht, and the complete rest and
freedom from exertion and excitement
were just what the tired boy needed.
At the end of the first week a faint
color began to appear in his pale
cheeks, and before the fortnight had
ended he was romping about on the
deck, his old happy, light-hearted self
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would think,&#8221; said his host to
Lord Ashden one day, as they sat together
in the cabin, the sound of Philip&#8217;s
merry laughter floating down to
them from the deck above, &#8220;who
would think that that mischievous
sprite could be the same boy as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
pale, spiritual-looking child violinist of
La Scala?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I confess I like him better this
way,&#8221; said Lord Ashden. &#8220;The Philip
of La Scala awed and frightened me a
little. I was afraid he would not live
to grow up, such children so often die
young; and I have lost so many of
those I have loved that it would be
very dreadful to think what life would
be to me without this dear child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old Frederick!&#8221; said his friend,
laying his hand affectionately on his
broad shoulders. &#8220;It is not strange
that you love the boy, and I hope with
all my heart that he may be spared to
you for many, many happy years to
come.&#8221;</p>

Home again</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;DEAR me!&#8221; said Philip, with a
long-drawn sigh, as the anchor
slipped from the bow of the yacht in
the harbor at Nice. &#8220;It is all nearly
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are not really sorry to be
going home, are you?&#8221; asked Lord
Ashden, who was standing beside
him watching the sailors as they made
their preparations for putting the party
ashore on the following morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; cried the boy, his face all
aglow; &#8220;only I have thought so much
about going back to England that it
hardly seems possible that it is so close
at hand; I have to pinch myself sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to reassure myself that it is all
really true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a queer thing life is anyway!&#8221;
said Lord Ashden, musing, as he looked
into the deep blue water that rippled
all around them. &#8220;Be we never so
happy in the present, we are always
looking forward to something just
ahead of us; and it is fortunate indeed
that we cannot penetrate the veil which
hides the future from our eyes. I can
remember so well, when I was your
age, looking forward with just the same
eagerness to what was just beyond, and
often when it came&mdash;but what&#8217;s the
matter, Philip, my boy?&mdash;you look as
though you were seeing ghosts, too.
Come, let us have a brisk walk on the
deck together, and perhaps we shall
succeed in feeling more cheerful.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Philip did not smile with his usual
gayety, and when his friend looked
down in surprise he saw that the boy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
eyes were full of tears. &#8220;Do you
know,&#8221; he said, in a low voice, &#8220;much
as I long to go to England, something
makes me half dread it; is it not a
strange feeling?&#8221;</p>

<p>Just at this moment the owner of the
yacht poked his head out of the companionway.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Philip,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s our
last night on board, you know, and we
may all be excused, I think, for feeling
a little sentimental: why can&#8217;t we have
a little music in the cabin? Shall I tell
Marvin to fetch your violin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; said Philip eagerly; &#8220;I
will get it myself,&#8221; and he ran off to
bring his beloved instrument from the
bottom of its travelling box, in which it
had been carefully packed to preserve
it from the effects of the salt air.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I play?&#8221; he said, as
he stood, bow in hand, under the
swinging lamp in the luxurious cabin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&#8220;Anything you like,&#8221; said their host,
making himself comfortable in a corner
of a sofa; &#8220;something of a soft and
dreamy kind, you know;&#8221; and Philip
began to play. He was always at his
best when he could improvise and
wander on at will, with no set programme
to follow, and to-night he
quite astonished his hearers with the
brilliancy of his performance, playing
on and on until the lamp burned
low, and at last flickered and went
out, and Lord Ashden sprang up,
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove! It must be getting rather
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said his friend, with a long
sigh, &#8220;I could have listened all night&mdash;I
never heard anything like it; but see
here, Philip, come here a moment, my
boy, and let me look at you. Are you
the same Philip I heard laughing and
shouting on the deck to-day? What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
do you know, a veritable baby like you,
about the sorrow and anguish and pain
of life? Your music to-night was full
of it; but how did it get there, that&#8217;s
what I want to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it so very sad, then?&#8221; asked
the boy, with simple regret. &#8220;I am
sorry. I did not mean to make it so, but
I did feel it all for a little while&mdash;it was
terrible,&#8221; and he raised his eyes, full of
a distress which he did not understand
himself, to his friend&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear little man, this will
never do. Come now, scamper off to
bed, and don&#8217;t let me catch you lying
awake thinking of solemn and disagreeable
things, or I shall never let you
come aboard my yacht again, <i>never</i>, do
you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something uncanny about
that boy,&#8221; he muttered, as he went up
on deck for a walk before turning in for
the night. &#8220;I would not tell Ashden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
so, of course, but I am not so sure
that his <i>protg</i> will live to grow up
and be the comfort and pleasure to
him which he expects he is going to
be. Poor Ashden!&#8221;</p>

<p>As for Philip, he was the first one on
deck next morning, and by breakfast-time
was ravenously hungry and in the
best of spirits, notwithstanding his regret
at leaving the yacht, which they
were to do in time to catch the morning
train for Paris. His high spirits continued
during the journey, and he chattered
and laughed, and teased Marvin,
the staid old man-servant, until Lord
Ashden was obliged to bribe him to
be quiet while he took a nap. The
passage from Calais to Dover was unusually
rough, but even the qualms of
seasickness did not altogether dampen
the boy&#8217;s spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going home, we are going
home,&#8221; he kept repeating. &#8220;In twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
hours we shall see Uncle Seldon
and Aunt Delia and the Nortons and
Dash. Dear old Dash&mdash;oh, I hope
he has not forgotten me!&#8221;</p>

<p>When they arrived at Dover they
found a telegram from Dr. Norton,
saying that the rector and his wife
had come down to London to meet
the travellers, and that they were all
awaiting their arrival with breathless
interest. Philip held the telegram in
his hand all the way to London, and
during the long trip in the cab to
Kensington, where the Nortons lived,
he was half sorry that they were not
going directly to Lowdown; but, after
all, that would have delayed the meeting
just so much longer.</p>

<p>The cab at last drew up before a
brightly lighted house, and some one
within must have been listening for the
sound of wheels, for before the man
could leave his box, the front door was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
thrown open, letting a broad blaze of
light out on the pavement.</p>

<p>To Philip&#8217;s dazzled eyes it seemed
as if the hallway was crowded with airy
figures pressing forward to greet them
as they entered, but it was only Lillie,
Rose, and the governess, in whom, to
his joy, he recognized his own old friend,
Miss Acton. She had changed but
little, but he never would have known
in any other place the two tall girls
who came forward with rather shy
cordiality to greet him. Aunt Delia
folded him in her arms, saying, &#8220;My
darling boy, my own boy, how glad I
am to have you here with me again, I
have longed for you so!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Norton and his wife were delighted
to see him, and the girls presently
forgot their first shyness in the
excitement of asking and answering
questions. It was a very merry party
which gathered around the supper-table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and Philip was touched to see
that Mrs. Norton had planned to have
all the dainties of which she remembered
Philip to have been particularly
fond in the old days at Lowdown.
Rose and Lillie fluttered about the
room, too happy to sit down quietly
with the others, and they kept heaping
delicacies on Philip&#8217;s plate until he
was obliged to assure them laughingly
that he did not possess the appetite
and digestion of an ostrich, and then
suddenly he stopped, with a buttered
crumpet half way to his mouth, to
ask where Marion was.</p>

<p>Miss Acton explained that she had
gone with friends to spend a few days
at a country house; she would be
back very shortly though, and perhaps
might not have gone had she known
that Lord Ashden and her cousin were
coming so soon.</p>

<p>That supposition was evidently added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to soothe a little disappointment that
was visible in Aunt Delia&#8217;s face. As
for Philip, he felt almost relieved that
he was not to meet Marion immediately.
His old admiration for her beauty had
not faded, but equally fresh was his
vivid remembrance of her scorn of the
little cousin she used to consider a disgrace
to the family.</p>

<p>He was very happy for the next few
days, giving himself up to the enjoyment
of being carried about to all
sorts of places by the twins and Miss
Acton.</p>

<p>&#8220;How nice it is to have a cousin
with us!&#8221; said Rose; &#8220;mamma won&#8217;t
let us go anywhere alone with Miss
Acton since we have grown so big, but
with you for a protector we can have
no end of larks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Philip may not fancy going
everywhere with a B. B. party,&#8221; said
Lillie, rather mischievously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>&#8220;I have no idea,&#8221; said Philip, &#8220;what
a B. B. party is, but I shall be only too
happy to go anywhere with you,&#8221; and
he glanced affectionately at Miss Acton
as if to include her.</p>

<p>&#8220;B. B. is short for bread-and-butter
party,&#8221; explained Rose; &#8220;that&#8217;s what
papa calls Miss Acton and Lillie and
me when we do get leave to go off to
the park, or the Zoo, or anything,
because we take our lunch with us so
as not to shock the proprieties by going
into any of those lovely, darling restaurants
for a bite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps my uncle wouldn&#8217;t mind
letting you go into a restaurant if you
took me along for an escort,&#8221; said Philip,
eager to please them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea!&#8221; said Rose pertly; &#8220;why,
he&#8217;d think we were crazy to ask him;
but maybe he would let us go into a
pastry-cook&#8217;s and have a Bath bun;
even that would be exciting, compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to getting round behind people to gobble
lunch out of a paper bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this, lunch at the pastry-cook&#8217;s
became a daily occurrence, and on one
seraphic day, when Aunt Delia was
persuaded to join the party, they celebrated
the old lady&#8217;s birthday by actually
dining at a restaurant, to the unutterable
delight of Rose, who had suggested
that form of dissipation as being, in her
mind, more ineffably jolly than any other
that was open to them.</p>

<p>Rest and recreation were so new to
Philip that he entered with all the zest
of a child into these simple pleasures,
and for a few days would not even think
of music. But as soon as the week he
had allowed himself to devote to pleasure
was over, he presented himself with
his letters from the old maestro, from
Lord Ashden, and from the managers
in Milan, to a notable musical leader in
London. Such powerful recommendations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and a private hearing of his
playing upon both violin and piano, accomplished
the result he desired, and
an appearance was arranged for him at
a concert in which a wonderful new
tenor and a celebrated prima donna
were to take part.</p>

<p>Even if he had been less talented, his
success might have been considered
certain, for Lord Ashden had written a
long letter to a prominent patron of
music and art, urging her to manifest
an interest in his <i>protg</i>. The lady, a
wealthy widowed duchess, with a fine
musical talent of her own, and a great
fancy for discovering and patronizing
young and unknown genius, responded
promptly to Lord Ashden&#8217;s request by
sending her card to Philip with an appointment
for him to call on the following
morning.</p>

<p>A desire from such a quarter was
equal to a command, so Philip presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
himself at the residence of Her Grace,
and was received most kindly. He
played, that was of course, and the lady
was enchanted&mdash;honestly so&mdash;and
kept him at it till he feared he must be
wearying her. He must make his
English <i>dbut</i> at her house; she
should insist upon having the glory
of being the first to exhibit this pearl
she had discovered. Such flattering
interest from such a source would
have turned some older heads than
his, but Philip accepted it all with
a grave simplicity that was irresistibly
charming to his patroness. It
seemed to him that the compliments
were to the music, not to himself; he
was simply the medium that evoked it;
as well praise the instrument for giving
it as him for drawing it out. As quietly
as he had received her praise, but with
becoming gratitude, he accepted her
invitation to play for her and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
friends on an evening before the concert.
The promise was given, however,
subject to the approval of the professional
leader, whose consent the lady
undertook to obtain herself.</p>

Marion</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">PHILIP went home in high spirits,
and the little party rejoiced over
his success and congratulated and complimented
him ecstatically. Lillie and
Rose had heard enough of his Milanese
triumph to predict the most wonderful
success for him, and revelled in anticipation
of the glory which would crown
his appearance. Their rapture was
complete when the postman brought a
box-order to Philip for his friends; and
although Dr. Norton was known to be
strict in prohibiting evening entertainments
to his younger daughters while
they were still in the care of a governess,
Aunt Delia ventured to promise
that just this once they should attend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>Two or three days before the concert,
Philip, coming into the house after a
rehearsal, felt as if he should like to
spend a quiet hour dreaming over the
music he was to play at the great concert.
It was, perhaps, one secret of
his wonderful power over his listeners
that when a composition pleased him,
he would think of it, dream of it, and
let it absorb his whole soul, the strains
throbbing through his inner consciousness
as vividly as if they were actual
sounds falling upon his ear.</p>

<p>Quietly, that he need not be seized
upon by his lively cousins, he stepped
into the darkened parlor and groped
his way to a vast easy-chair, whose
luxuriously cushioned depths invited
repose of mind and body; sinking into
it, he covered his eyes with his hands
and began to recall the harmony he had
just rehearsed. But a murmur of voices
broke the silence&mdash;Lillie&#8217;s and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
fresh and young like hers, but unfamiliar.
He suspected that it might be his
cousin Marion, and the next words
convinced him that it was. She had
returned while he was absent, and,
with Lillie, was discussing the things
that had happened during their separation.
Rose had been attacked by a
sudden feverish cold, and Aunt Delia
had sent them downstairs, fearing their
chatter might disturb her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Rosy! I&#8217;m sorry she&#8217;s sick,&#8221;
Philip heard, in the voice that was new
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is very hard for her,&#8221;
responded Lillie. &#8220;Particularly as she
was so anxious to go to the concert and
hear Philip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How you all rave about Philip!&#8221;
said Marion. &#8220;You and Aunt Delia,
and even Miss Acton, have talked about
him ever since I came into the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Lillie, &#8220;we are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
devoted to him; and oh, Marion, he is
so charming, so beautiful, so talented,
every one is wild about him! You
have heard about his wonderful triumph
at La Scala; and now the duchess
has taken him up, and seems to be infatuated
about him, and the manager
prophesies that he will be the greatest
success of the season. He is so perfectly
modest about himself, too, I long
to have you see him. I am sure you
will become just as proud of him as we
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>What blessed words were these for
the happy listener to hear!&mdash;for he did
hear them, without even a thought of
the impropriety of listening to a conversation
between people who supposed
themselves alone. The delight
of learning that his relatives gloried in
the honors paid to the son of one who
had once been called a disgrace to the
family so entranced him that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
unconscious of everything else. He
listened eagerly for Marion&#8217;s reply,
losing for a moment the ever-present
recollection of her old disdain of him.
Her answer came in clear, cold tones
that cut him like a knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Proud of him, Lillie! If he were a
hundred times as beautiful and talented
as you say, I should only feel a hundred
times as much ashamed of being related
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Marion, don&#8217;t say that!&#8221; exclaimed
Lillie, in sudden distress; &#8220;I
thought you were over that feeling long
ago. Just think how every one speaks
of him, and only this morning papa
was saying how proud we ought to
be of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Marion, &#8220;I know it; but
I know too that papa, in his secret
heart, although he will never let himself
say it, feels just as I do. It was
a whim of Lord Ashden&#8217;s to educate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
him, and he can afford to enjoy his
public triumph now because every one
knows he is nothing to him; but all this
notoriety makes our shame greater.
Fancy being pointed out as the cousin
of a professional musician! How can I
ever go to the Crawfords&#8217; or the Ashleighs&#8217;
again, or look any of my friends
in the face, with such a fact made
public!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Marion,&#8221; said tender-hearted
Lillie, now sobbing, &#8220;see how he is
received by the duchess. He went
there last night, and this morning Lady
Leaycroft left a card for him. She is
Lord Ashden&#8217;s cousin, you know, and
Aunt Delia says that after he has appeared
at the duchess&#8217; morning musicale
he will be invited by all her
friends. You know you would give
anything to go to such houses yourself,
Marion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, as an equal perhaps I should,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
said Marion scornfully, &#8220;but not to
be looked upon as occupying a menial
position. Why, such people would regard
Philip as of no more account
socially than a flunky. They like to be
entertained, and are willing to let him
amuse them, but that is all. I have no
doubt that even Lord Ashden thinks
him no better than a valet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hard, cruel, false, and unjust words
falling from beautiful lips perfect enough
to be chosen as an artist&#8217;s model, but
coming from a heart filled with malice,
envy, and dark, unlovely traits. And
Philip, shrinking back into the depths of
the great chair, beaten down as if by a
blow, heard them all.</p>

<p>He found Marion at the table with
the others, when he rather tardily
answered the summons to dinner, and
their meeting was quiet and cool
enough. She showed nothing of the
cordiality which her sisters felt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
him, and his manner to her was as distant
and grave as if he were the proud
and self-sufficient relative instead of
the obscure musician, whose birth and
profession were disgraceful in her eyes.</p>

<p>But with all his quiet manner he
never, for one half-instant, lost the bitter
memory of those terrible words of
Marion&#8217;s that had crushed his sensitive
nature and wounded him more fearfully
than if his actual living flesh had been
pierced by a barb of steel. In his humility
he never once thought of resenting
even in thought the unkindness of
her speech, or comforted himself with
an assurance that her words were
cruelly unjust; he simply sank into
blank despair at the belief that all his
efforts to elevate himself had been in
vain, and all his hopes of winning
fame and glory by his art the idle fancies
of an ignorant dreamer.</p>

<p>Locked in his own room, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
family believed him still at the rehearsal,
he had a fierce struggle with himself,
and it was only love for dear old
Aunt Delia and gratitude to Lord
Ashden that helped him to regain composure
at last, and not follow his first
impulsive determination to fly anywhere,
anywhere, off, far, far off, where they
never should find him or hear of him
again. But self-pleasing had never been
his habit, so it came rather more naturally
to him than it might to some to
conquer his own desires and compel
himself to keep the engagements for
the public and private concerts, the
thought of which had now grown hateful
to him.</p>

<p>His beautiful spiritual face was startlingly
pale and his hands trembled nervously,
but Aunt Delia never doubted
but that these were the signs of a natural
excitement caused by the anticipation
of the approaching concert. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
appearance and manners showed refinement
and cultivation so far beyond
anything that Marion had expected to
see that she was really greatly surprised
and, in spite of her previous sentiments,
interested in him. But not even to her
sister would she admit that her views
were in any way changed, and when
going to the concert was discussed, she
would not acknowledge any desire to
hear Philip play, but appeared to give
her consent to going with Lillie and
Miss Acton simply to please the others.</p>

<p>After dinner Aunt Delia whispered
to Philip that she would like to have
him stop in her room for a moment on
his way upstairs. He followed her
almost immediately, and his ruffled feelings
were soothed at once under the
influence of her gentle presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; she said, when they
had entered the pleasant chamber together
and she had closed the door, &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
have something for you which I am
sure will please you&mdash;and which I
hope you will enjoy carrying about with
you as much as I have enjoyed having
it prepared for you.&#8221; She unlocked a
drawer and took from it a small square
box which she laid in Philip&#8217;s hand;
the boy removed the outer covering
with fingers which trembled with pleasure
and excitement, and drew forth
from its wrappings of tissue-paper a
small oval case of dark leather. Touching
a spring at the side, the case flew
open, and Philip gave a little gasp of
wonder and delight as he gazed upon
two portraits, similar in size and execution,
of his father and mother. They
were exquisitely painted on ivory, and
Philip noticed at once that the picture
of his father was exactly similar to
the one which his mother had worn
about her neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;But my mother!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
is perfect&mdash;her eyes, her hair, her
mouth; the artist must have seen her,
surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did,&#8221; said Aunt Delia gently,
&#8220;for the artist was your father, Philip.
You remember that in the old desk
which stood in your mother&#8217;s room, and
which we opened after her death, there
were a number of papers and packages,
the greater part of no particular value.
You will also remember that you asked
me to take charge of these and look
them over at my leisure. Well, it was
not until a month ago that I had the
heart to do so, and from the first package
which I untied there fell out your
mother&#8217;s picture, which your father
must have painted just before or
perhaps soon after their marriage. It
occurred to me all at once that the two
portraits (that of your father I had
already planned to give you on your
return to England) could be framed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
together, for in death they are not
divided.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Aunt Delia,&#8221; murmured the
boy, his swimming eyes fixed upon his
mother&#8217;s face as though he would have
devoured it, &#8220;how can I thank you?&mdash;and
oh, how I wish that you could have
known my mother! I know, I feel sure,
that you would have loved her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do love her, my boy,&#8221; said Aunt
Delia quietly, &#8220;and I believe her to
have been a lovely and noble woman,
and fully worthy of the love of a fine
man like your father, Philip.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy turned and flung his arms
about Mrs. Seldon&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Delia, thank you!&#8221; he
sobbed. &#8220;It is just that which I have
longed to hear you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the two went downstairs
together arm in arm, Philip&#8217;s face was
so radiant that when Lillie whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Marion! Is not Philip really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
beautiful to-night?&#8221; her sister was
forced to reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I must acknowledge that he is
tolerably good-looking.&#8221;</p>

The Concert</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">PHILIP&#8217;S manager had consented,
although rather reluctantly, that
the boy should play a night or two
before the concert at the house of Lord
Ashden&#8217;s friend, the duchess, who had
shown him so much kindness upon his
arrival in London. She had gathered
together three or four score of her particular
friends, who belonged to the
most critical musical set in London,
and when Lord Ashden looked around
the room and began to discern the character
of the audience, he glanced rather
anxiously at Philip.</p>

<p>Never before had he been so impressed
with the boy&#8217;s extreme youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and with his entire simplicity and unconsciousness,
as he came modestly
forward with his pretty air of being
genuinely pleased by the sound of
clapping hands which greeted him;
and as he flashed upon the company
one of his sunny smiles the women
murmured, &#8220;What a little love!&#8221; and
the men, many of them hardened concert-goers,
drew up their chairs, prepared
to listen with some curiosity to
this fragile morsel of humanity, of whose
wonderful playing they had heard such
great things from their hostess.</p>

<p>&#8220;He hardly looks as though he had
strength enough to handle the bow
through such a difficult selection as he
has chosen to begin his programme
with,&#8221; said a stout violincellist; &#8220;but
we shall see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip played his best, and as usual,
after the first bar or two, he forgot
all about himself and his audience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and thought only of the music before
him. The second selection he played
without notes, and with a sympathy
and abandon which astonished his
hearers; and the final number of the
programme finished, as he lowered his
bow and stood for a moment in the
centre of the room, there was a hush
of astonishment and pleasure. Then
the applause began, lasting for full five
minutes, while the people gathered
around Philip, shaking hands and kissing
him, the older musicians among the
first to pay their willing tribute to his
genius.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is wonderful&mdash;marvellous!&#8221;
Lord Ashden heard them saying on all
sides. &#8220;What a career he has ahead of
him!&#8221; And in the midst of it all he
felt a warm little hand slipped into
his, and Philip&#8217;s voice whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, dear Lord Ashden, let us
go home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you like all that petting,
my dear boy?&#8221; Lord Ashden asked
in an amused voice as they rolled away
from the musicale in the duchess&#8217; own
carriage, which she had insisted upon
sending for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Philip thoughtfully.
&#8220;I am glad they like my music
of course, but somehow&mdash;a word or
two from you, or one of dear Signor
Marini&#8217;s funny little grunts of approval,
seems to make me ten times happier.
I wish&#8221;&mdash;he paused a moment and his
eyes shone in the darkness of the carriage&mdash;&#8220;I
wish I could thank you. I
pray each night that God will reward
you for all that you have done for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has rewarded me,&#8221; exclaimed
Lord Ashden, &#8220;by sending you to be
the comfort and joy of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night of the concert came at last,
and Philip was by all odds the calmest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and least excited of the party. Lord
Ashden had some misgivings as to the
result of this first public appearance
in England, for in spite of the boy&#8217;s undoubted
success at La Scala he knew
that the audience of a London concert-hall
were far more likely to be coldly
critical than the music-loving and excitable
Italians. He realized, too, that
upon the success or failure of this
rather bold experiment depended in
large measure the young violinist&#8217;s
future career, and he confessed secretly
to Aunt Delia that he would be relieved
and glad when the evening was over.
As for the dear old lady herself, she was
scarcely able to control her excitement,
and she kept following Philip about the
house all day with milk-punches and
some hom&oelig;opathic pellets which she
had been told were excellent for the
nerves.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Philip has no nerves,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Lord Ashden, laughing, and baring
the boy&#8217;s wrist that Aunt Delia might
lay her hand upon the pulse which was
beating with the calmness and regularity
of a trip-hammer. As for Philip,
he could only repeat what he had said
at Milan:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can but play my best, and I hope
the audience may like it; at any rate, I
have no fear of breaking down, for I
know my score perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>His cousins were all excitement and
affectionate interest, all, that is to say,
except Marion, who continued to maintain
her air of haughty disdain, and
once or twice when the others were
talking of the concert, she even yawned
perceptibly, and at last left the room.</p>

<p>Philip, try as he would not to care,
was deeply wounded by her behavior,
and in his humility he felt that he must
be in some way deserving of her scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is so clever,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
so perfectly at her ease in a drawing-room!
I suppose that in comparison I
must appear very green and awkward;
and yet Rose and Lillie seem to like
me. I wonder if they are only kind to
me because they fear to hurt my feelings?&#8221;</p>

<p>And thus the poor sensitive boy
tormented himself up to the moment
when the carriage appeared at the door
to take them to the concert; then, fortunately
for his peace of mind, he began
to think of the music which he was
about to play, and this soon drove all
other thoughts from his mind.</p>

<p>Dash had spent the day close at
Philip&#8217;s heels, and as the evening
approached he seemed to feel that
something unusual was to occur; and
when at last the party assembled in
the hall, ready to start for the concert,
the little creature&#8217;s excitement increased,
and he went from one to the other, begging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
so earnestly to be taken along that
Philip at last said laughingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that Dash thinks I am
going away on another journey, for he
whines precisely as he did when we
started for Italy three years ago. Be
a good dog! Down, Dash! You
know you cannot go, and, after all, I
will soon be back, you foolish dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dash only barked and fidgeted
the more, and at last when they were
all in the carriage, he broke away from
the servant who was trying to hold him
in the hall, and springing into the coach
attempted to creep under the seat.
Philip, however, was too quick for him,
and dragging him forth again carried
him back into the house. As they
drove down the street they could hear
him howling dismally, and Dr. Norton
remarked laughingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is fortunate we don&#8217;t believe in
signs, Philip, or Dash&#8217;s howling would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
certainly be looked upon as a bad
omen.&#8221;</p>

<p>They remembered this afterwards,
and also that Philip replied in his
clear, sweet voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dash is a very wise dog, Uncle
Frank, and perhaps he had his own
reasons for whining as he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip was very quiet during the
drive to the concert-hall, which was
quite a long one, and indeed none of
the party felt much inclined toward
conversation until Marion said at last:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, how solemn and stupid
we all are. One would think we were
going to a funeral. I wish it were all
over,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We shall be so
conspicuous, and I hate crowds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marion!&#8221; said her mother reprovingly.
And glancing at Philip she was
glad to notice that he had not apparently
heeded his cousin&#8217;s remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have a serious talk with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Marion,&#8221; said Mrs. Norton to herself.
&#8220;She seems to have grown quite
thoughtless of the feelings of others of
late, and I am afraid she has wounded
Philip several times since her return.
What can have come over her, I
wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the carriage drew up
before the stage-door, and Philip was
pounced upon by his manager and
carried off, while the others slowly
made their way through the crowds
which were pouring into the building,
to the box which had been reserved
for their party near the stage.</p>

<p>There were to be other performers
besides Philip&mdash;a celebrated pianist, a
player on the harp, and a popular prima
donna; so many attractions filled the
house that even Marion, looking at
the brilliant audience, was forced to
acknowledge that it was a great compliment
to Philip&#8217;s playing that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
should have been asked to appear on
such an occasion; while Lord Ashden
felt some nervous apprehension as he
remarked several of the most distinguished
musical critics in London in
a box near their own.</p>

<p>Just before Philip&#8217;s turn to play came
on the programme, a friend of Lord
Ashden sent down from his box in the
centre of the house to suggest that
the party should join him there, as a
better view of the whole house and of
Philip&#8217;s effect upon the audience could
be gained at a greater distance from
the stage; so Dr. and Mrs. Norton,
Mrs. Seldon and Lord Ashden, quietly
made the change, leaving the girls in
charge of Miss Acton during their absence.</p>

<p>The latter shared with Lillie her nervousness
and excitement, and they were
both so full of hopes and fears for
Philip that they hardly gave civil attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to the professor&#8217;s wonderful piano
gymnastics, or listened to Madame Lalage
when she sang Cherubini&#8217;s &#8220;Ave&#8221;
in her thrilling and matchless voice.
And even Marion leaned breathlessly
forward, forgetful for once of herself
and her becoming new gown, as the
prima donna&#8217;s billowy robes and shimmering
satin train swept out of sight
and Philip stepped quietly forth upon
the stage.</p>

<p>They need not have feared for him,
for he was perfectly composed, and
stood looking curiously about the house,
smiling a little and waiting until the
applause which followed the retreating
favorite should have quite died away.
He was unknown to the greater part of
the audience, and a murmur went about
the house; he was so young, a mere
baby,&mdash;was it possible he could play?
And then he raised his violin and began.
The people glanced at their programmes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
&#8220;Bach&#8217;s Allemande, Suite
No. 2, in C Major.&#8221; Another flutter
of surprise, and then gradually silence,
deep and profound, as dreamily and
rhythmically the wave-like accentuation
of the mystical melody fell upon
the listening ears which were entranced
by the wonderful pathos of
the composition as the young performer
rendered it. An intense stillness
held the whole house, and not a
note was lost till he finished, and with
downcast eyes made his low, grave
salutation, and turned to leave the
stage. Before he vanished a superb
bouquet from the duchess was handed
him, and his patroness herself from her
box bent forward with sparkling eyes,
bowing and smiling her delighted approval.</p>

<p>The spellbound audience rallied then
and deafened itself with applause,
but owing to the length of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
bill there were to be no encores;
so the pianist took his place, to be
succeeded by the other performers,
and then, after another song by Lalage,
Philip returned, and as he took his
place there was a rather quick fluttering
of programmes as people looked
quickly to see what they were to hear
from the beautiful, wonderful boy violinist.
But &#8220;A Study,&#8221; with no composer&#8217;s
name annexed, gave no clue to
what they might expect.</p>

<p>He began with a sweet, soft melody
in A, a pathetic lullaby that seemed,
with all its sweetness, to carry a desolate
sadness that made the tears start
to many eyes; then the music changed
strangely, and wild, defiant sounds
took the place of the unutterably sweet
melody; gradually these new sounds
gave way to throbbing, wailing strains,
which told of unfathomable sorrow
and hopeless despair. The keen agony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
that the music expressed seemed to
oppress the audience, and many of
them wept unrestrainedly. Lillie and
Miss Acton, feeling certain that the
&#8220;Study&#8221; was Philip&#8217;s own composition,
and was the musical expression
of his own thoughts, shrank to the
back of the box to conceal their convulsive
weeping. Marion kept her
place, but even she lifted her handkerchief
to wipe the tears from her eyes.
She could hardly feel ashamed of her
emotion when she saw the impulsive
and music-loving duchess opposite
sobbing like a child; but no one is
all evil, and perhaps the music really
touched what was good and genuine
in her nature, and elevated her for the
time above the arrogance that made
her unlovely in spite of all her grace
and beauty.</p>

<p>In another moment the pitiful minor
passages that were thrilling the listeners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
would have become unbearable, but
sweet flashes of sound began to break
through, and the woe melted into a
lovely pastoral that, like a song without
words, told the story of a quiet,
happy life, with only the occasional
anguish of a dull minor strain that
broke upon the calm like the disturbing
intrusion of a haunting, uneasy
thought that could not always be repressed.
Once, as he played, he turned
his head slightly and looked fixedly for
a moment into his cousins&#8217; box, and the
color burned for an instant in his pale
face as he met Marion&#8217;s tearful eyes;
but there was no pause in the music,
and if any one noticed the passing emotion,
no one understood it. And once
again the thunder of clapping hands
passed over the house as the young
musician quietly withdrew, and people
turned their programmes to see if he
was to play again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>&#8220;Once more,&#8221; they murmured, and
Lillie and Miss Acton retired again to
the back of the box, where this time
they were joined by Marion, to talk
over their cousin&#8217;s triumph.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XIX<br />

Fire</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">FOR the third and last time that
evening Philip stepped upon the
stage; he knew his audience now, and
they knew him, and settled back to
enjoy the treat which surely awaited
them; and they were not disappointed.
The boy threw his whole soul into his
music, and the vast building might
almost have been empty, so silent was
the listening crowd. And then there
came a moment&#8217;s pause between the
movements in the music, and Philip
threw back his head for an instant in
a way he had; as he did so he saw
something which drove the blood to his
heart, for high above his head a corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of light drapery had been blown against
a lighted gas-jet, and a little curling
tongue of flame had just started
on its way along the edge of the curtain.
Philip went on at once with his
playing, but as he played he stepped,
almost unperceived, nearer to one side
of the stage, where he knew the manager
was standing, and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, above your head,&#8221; and
the sweet, unfaltering melody flowed
smoothly on; but soon the little tongue
of flame had crept around to the front
of the curtain, and suddenly a strange
agitation seemed to possess the audience.
The people rose to their feet in
evident alarm, frightened cries were
heard, and some rushed from their seats
into the aisles, while from some quarter
came the terrible cry of &#8220;Fire!&#8221; The
manager came to the front of the stage
and implored the people to be calm
and avoid the crowding and crushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
that would result unless they left the
building in an orderly way, for which
he assured them there was abundant
time if they would avoid a panic. For
a moment they listened to his exhortation
and seemed to obey, but even as
he spoke the flames began to dart
through the billow-like rolls of smoke
that curled around the wall upon one
side. Then there was an instant&#8217;s hush
of dismay as the fire caught the end of
some hanging drapery, and followed
its festoonings, in a wild, blazing
wreath, around the room, catching in
its mad rush the light varnished wood
trimmings, that burned like tinder. The
crowd became ungovernable then, and
a frightful scene of confusion ensued as
they fought their way toward the entrance,
defeating, in their frantic haste,
the efforts of those who were cool
enough to direct their movements.</p>

<p>Philip, while the manager was speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
had stood with calm self-possession,
revolving in his mind what was best to
be done. It would have been very easy
to have retreated at once through the
back of the stage, but of this he did
not think for an instant, and he turned
towards the box where the young
Nortons were sitting. It was only a
few feet above the stage, and he
sprang towards it, holding out his
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come quickly!
It is but a step; jump upon the stage
and we will get out through the dressing-room.
I know the way, and it is
the only thing to do&mdash;the corridors are
already blocked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Acton helped the girls over the
edge of the box and down upon the
stage, following herself with Philip&#8217;s
assistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the others?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe, I am sure,&#8221; replied Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Acton, speaking quickly. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
staircase near the entrance of their
box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come with me,&#8221; said Philip.</p>

<p>They remembered afterwards how
calm he was, and that he looked back
and smiled encouragement over his
shoulder as he rapidly led the way
towards the back of the stage; but the
flames had made great headway in the
short time since they were first discovered,
and the narrow passageways
behind the wings were filled with
smoke. For an instant Philip hesitated,
but glancing back he saw that
there was no hope of escape through
the house, which was filled with a
pushing, struggling mass of terrified
men and women. He turned again,
bidding the others follow him, and they
obeyed; but when he had led them to
the back of the stage, in the very
direction in which the fire was approaching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Marion shrank back and
refused to follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will die if you stay,&#8221;
exclaimed Philip, seizing her arm and
drawing her forcibly along, and at the
same time calling to the others to follow,
which they did, pale and trembling,
but never attempting to question his wisdom
in leading them through a door at
which the flames were already darting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot go there, I cannot!&#8221;
screamed Marion, pulling back and
looking toward the auditorium, where
the struggling people were packed
closer and closer about the door, and
where terrible cries of anguish told
that the bitterness of death was coming
to some upon whom the stronger and
fiercer trampled, without waiting for the
flames they were fleeing from.</p>

<p>There was no hope there, and Philip
knew there was no time to be lost, so he
half lifted, half dragged Marion through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the door, still resisting, but half fainting
with terror. There was a long lobby
to go through, then another door to
open, and they found themselves in a
small triangular room in which was one
window and another door opening upon
a narrow staircase, which led directly
to one of the outer doors. To this door
Philip sprang as they entered the little
apartment, but, alas! it was securely
locked and the key withdrawn; he
made one mad effort to force the door,
but it offered the firmest resistance.
Then he remembered that at rehearsal
the manager had given him a key, that
he might leave the building by that
door after his last piece should be
played, if he chose not to wait for the
end of the concert. Unhappily, instead
of putting the key in his pocket, he had
carried it to his dressing-room, and now
he remembered distinctly having thrown
it upon the table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>There was one appalling moment of
dismay for them all, then Lillie said
solemnly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and try to save yourself, Philip;
perhaps you can find a way out if you
have not us to take care of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will save you yet,&#8221; said Philip
with quiet determination. &#8220;I will go
for the key,&#8221; and he rushed away from
them through the narrow passage toward
the stage, where the fire now roared and
thundered with a fury indescribable.
His dressing-room could be reached by
a short hallway behind the stage. It was
chokingly full of thick, black smoke,
but, holding his breath, he dashed
through it and gained the place he
sought. The dressing-room was also
full of smoke, but he seized the key and
rushed again to the passage. In that
instant of time fire had taken the place
of smoke, and it seemed as if to attempt
to go through it would be to court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
certain and swift destruction. There
was another door, and it led, as Philip
knew, to the large back stairway in
that part of the building as yet unattacked
by the flames. To open the
door and fly down those stairs meant
escape from a fiery death; but to go
would be to leave his friends to perish
miserably in the little room to which he
had taken them. He hesitated only
long enough to tear off his coat and
drench it in a basin of water; then wrapping
it over his head, he plunged into
the gulf of fire. What the horror and
agony of that passage was, no one will
ever know; but he reached his cousins,
who were already driven, by smoke and
approaching flames, into the remotest
corner of the little room. He threw
them the key as he fell to the floor, unable
to take another step.</p>

<p>They opened the door, and between
them dragged him into the purer air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and supported him down the stairs
to the street, where he was at once
taken care of by the crowd who were
gathered to look on and assist if possible.</p>

<p>The panic in the front of the house
soon subsided, for the fire-engines which
came from all over London quickly
put out the flames, and the greatest
damage caused by the fire had been
behind the stage. But many had been
trampled on and injured in the stampede
of the audience for the doors, and the
police and ambulance surgeons had all
that they could possibly do. Philip was
carried immediately into a small shop
in the neighborhood, where half a dozen
sympathizing strangers promised to care
for him and the girls, who were half
unconscious from the smoke which
they had inhaled, while Miss Acton
went to look for the remainder of the
party, who she knew would be frantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
with anxiety as to the fate of the
children.</p>

<p>She did at last succeed in finding
Lord Ashden and Dr. Norton, who had
sent the ladies home in a cab, while
they returned to search for Philip and
Miss Acton&#8217;s party, whom they had
seen clambering over the box, and
who they supposed had escaped without
difficulty through the back way. When
Miss Acton told them as quietly as
she could that Philip had been hurt, although
she hoped not seriously so, Lord
Ashden staggered and would have
fallen had not Dr. Norton supported
him, and when they entered the dingy
back room in the little shop where
Philip lay, white and unconscious, on
the sofa, his guardian sank upon the
floor beside him and covered his face
with his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy, my boy!&#8221; he moaned. But
in an instant he recovered himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
made arrangements to have the whole
party taken home as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The surgeon, whose services had at
last been secured, did what he could to
restore Philip to consciousness, but without
success. &#8220;He is suffering from
shock,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and may remain insensible
for several hours. Get him home
and to bed as quickly as possible; I do
not think his burns are serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he hurried away to relieve the
sufferings of a lady who had been trampled
on by the crowd.</p>

<p>It was a sad party which drove back
to Kensington; the sisters were only
half aroused from the sort of stupor
which seemed to have fallen upon them,
and they lay back in the carriage,
while upon the other seat sat Lord Ashden,
supporting the unconscious Philip
in his arms, and keeping his eyes fixed
upon the boy&#8217;s face with an expression
of silent agony.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>Miss Acton and Dr. Norton, who
had driven home more rapidly, reached
the house in time to prepare the minds
of Mrs. Norton and Aunt Delia, and to
get rooms and beds in readiness for the
sufferers, and despatch messengers for
medical aid.</p>

<p>The physician who examined Philip
shook his head and looked grave, although
he spoke encouragingly. The
patient was suffering principally from
shock and from the effects of the smoke
which he had inhaled in such quantities.
His burns were not serious, however,
though they would doubtless be painful
and require careful nursing; he
proposed, nevertheless, to spend the
night with his patient, and asked that a
trained nurse be sent for at once,
while, for the present at least, everybody
must be excluded from the sick-room
but Aunt Delia and himself.</p>

<p>And so, after the poor burned hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
had been tenderly dressed and the little
sufferer made as clean and comfortable
as possible, the silence which had
been so imperatively ordered settled
down upon the sick-room, and there
was no sound but the quick, irregular
breathing of the patient and the ticking
of the clock on the mantel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XX<br />

The End</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">LORD ASHDEN spent that night
pacing restlessly up and down
the floor, and when the doctor came
out of the sick-chamber early the following
morning, he called him into his
room. &#8220;I want to know,&#8221; he began in
a strange, monotonous voice, &#8220;just
what the chances are for the boy&#8217;s life.
No, don&#8217;t try to spare me, please. I
prefer to know the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician, a strictly professional
and apparently unsympathetic man, was
moved to sudden pity as he remarked
the traces of intense suffering in Lord
Ashden&#8217;s face and manner:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; he said, an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in his eyes which was most
unusual to them, &#8220;I did not know the
little chap was so dear to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is all I have,&#8221; said Lord Ashden
quietly. &#8220;All I have,&#8221; he repeated
as though to himself, and then he went
on:</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have not told me yet what
you think of his condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the strictly professional man
who spoke this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is difficult to tell&mdash;just yet,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;The burns are serious, although
not necessarily fatal, and there has been
a great shock to the general system, a
very great shock; the action of the
heart is weak, and there is a deplorable
lack of vitality and less recuperative
energy than I could wish to see. However&#8221;&mdash;He
paused and looked at
Lord Ashden steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said almost sternly, and,
taking up the physician&#8217;s sentence, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
added, &#8220;you have, in short, little encouragement
to offer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the doctor slowly,
&#8220;that the boy&#8217;s chances are about
even; yes, about even,&#8221; he repeated,
and then he held out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I will
return in a few hours. And be assured,
my dear sir, that everything possible
will be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Lord Ashden,
opening the door to allow the physician
to pass through; and as the latter went
downstairs he heard the door close
again, and the sound of a key turning
in the lock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellow!&#8221; the busy surgeon
said, as he buttoned up his coat and
went briskly down the steps, &#8220;poor
fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Toward noon of that day Philip
began to come out of the kind of stupor
in which he had lain all night. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
smiled faintly at Aunt Delia as she
leaned over the bed, and tried to speak,
but he was too weak, and presently he
closed his eyes again. He suffered a
good deal from the burns, which quite
covered his hands and arms, and as
night came on again he grew restless
and feverish, talking incoherently and
sometimes starting up in bed; once he
thought the manager was calling him
to go upon the stage and play.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a moment!&#8221; he cried, and then
he lay back upon the pillow, smiling.
&#8220;They are clapping,&#8221; he whispered;
&#8220;they like my music, I think, and I am
glad&mdash;for Lord Ashden&#8217;s sake.&#8221; After
that the pain grew worse, and he
tossed restlessly about on the bed,
sometimes moaning, and muttering indistinctly
to himself; now and then
the watchers caught a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready, sir! Is it my turn to go
on? Are they all there, Aunt Delia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Lord Ashden, Miss Acton? All but
Marion, I don&#8217;t see her. Wouldn&#8217;t she
stay to hear me play? Oh, yes, there
she is, sitting between Miss Acton and
Lillie, dear little Lillie! I must play
my very best to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the concert&mdash;always the concert;
once when he lay so quiet that
they thought he was asleep, there was
a distant sound of the barking of a dog.
&#8220;Dash!&#8221; he exclaimed, opening his
eyes, and he made them understand
that he wanted to see his favorite.
Aunt Delia hesitated, but the nurse
nodded her head, and the little dog
was sent for from a distant part of
the house where he had been confined,
an unwilling captive. The poor little
fellow seemed to realize that something
dreadful had happened, and when
he was brought to Philip&#8217;s bed he
neither fidgeted nor barked, but remained
perfectly quiet, his dumb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
loving soul looking out of his bright
eyes. Philip tried to hold out his poor
bandaged arms, and they laid the dog
gently beside him; it was very touching
to see the joy of both; Dash
crawled as closely as he could to
Philip&#8217;s side, and the boy lay looking
at him with a faint smile of perfect satisfaction.
&#8220;Dear little Dash!&#8221; he murmured,
and then he closed his eyes
again. That night he grew much
worse, and Lord Ashden, pacing restlessly
about in the adjoining room,
covered his ears to shut out the sound
of groans and feeble cries which
pierced his great loving heart like
sharp knives. He was trying with all
his might to reconcile himself to the
thought of giving up the dear child
who had wound himself so closely
around the strong man&#8217;s affections.
&#8220;<i>She</i> was taken from me,&#8221; he moaned
&#8220;and God knows I loved her; and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
he is going too, and he is all I have&mdash;all
I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not once or twice, but many times,
during the night Aunt Delia stole in to
comfort him; her heart, too, was very
near to breaking, but she had learned to
say, &#8220;Thy will be done,&#8221; and her sweet
wrinkled face, on which were the traces
of recent tears, wore a look of peace
and resignation which Lord Ashden
observed with wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should God punish us in this
way?&#8221; he said once, and his companion
laid her fingers gently on the rebellious
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she said; &#8220;do not say that,
dear friend; when, three years ago (it
seems but yesterday), you came to us
and asked that you might take Philip
to Italy, it was very hard to give him
up, yet his uncle and I knew that it
was for the boy&#8217;s best good; we said
&#8216;Go&#8217; when our hearts were murmuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
&#8216;Stay.&#8217; Would it not have been
selfish to have kept our Philip by our
side in the narrow circle of our love
and care, when before him lay the
chance of the life of Italy and the
musical training which he so needed
and wished for? And now, dear, dear
friend, think a moment; may it not be
something the same way now? Surely
our Heavenly Father knows what is
best for our darling, when He would
take him from our clinging arms into
the fuller life of light and love.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and laid her hand with
the most caressing tenderness upon the
bowed head of her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be brave, I know, dear
heart,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;God bless
and help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few hours later the whole family
were gathered in a sorrowful group
around Philip&#8217;s bed. The end was very
near, the doctor said, and the boy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
asked to see them, calling for each one
by name. He looked about upon the
familiar faces, his own shining with love
and peace, and there was no trace
of fear or even of regret in his calm,
clear eyes. Strangely enough, it was
Marion&#8217;s name which he spoke first,
and he tried to hold out his hand, stiff
and heavy with bandages, as she knelt
sobbing beside his pillow. &#8220;Why do
you cry?&#8221; he asked wonderingly.
&#8220;Not for me, surely, dear cousin;
there is no pain now, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Philip, Philip,&#8221; cried the girl,
&#8220;forgive me! Only say that you forgive
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to forgive, dear
Marion,&#8221; replied the boy; &#8220;I love
you very much; you will not forget
that I said so, will you, dear?&#8221; And
Miss Acton gently led the weeping girl
from the room.</p>

<p>Philip followed her with troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
eyes, and then he turned to the others;
he had a word for each, but his chief
thought was for Lord Ashden, who sat
beside the bed, outwardly quite calm,
for he feared to disturb Philip by any
show of emotion; he even tried to smile
when the boy looked at him, and bent
low over the pillow to hear the whispered
words. The others moved away
while the two talked together, and no
one else heard what the boy said to his
friend. Once or twice the latter gave a
great, deep sob, and Aunt Delia coming
to his side for an instant heard Philip
whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see <i>her</i>, you know, Lord
Ashden. Do you suppose she will
know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor says you must not talk
any more for the present, dear boy,&#8221;
whispered Mrs. Seldon softly, and Philip
looked up with a radiant smile and a
little weary, but quite contented, sigh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>&#8220;I am a little tired,&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;I will sleep awhile,&#8221; and he closed his
eyes, but presently he opened them
again and looked around the room.
&#8220;Are they all here?&#8221; he asked faintly.
&#8220;I cannot quite see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all here,&#8221; replied Lord Ashden
steadily; and Philip looked up
languidly and smiled.</p>

<p>He lay very still after this, only opening
his eyes once when Dash moved a
little closer to his side. The nurse would
have taken the dog away, but Philip
shook his head, and after that there was
perfect stillness in the room. The end
came very quietly&mdash;so quietly that they
thought he was only asleep, until the
nurse nodded gravely to Aunt Delia
and she arose and put her arms around
Lord Ashden, whispering:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, dear Frederick, our Philip
has gone home.&#8221;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
